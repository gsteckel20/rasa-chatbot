"while the pursuit of these fundamental questions has guided me through several related academic fields (modernist studies, comparative literature, american studies, cold war studies, continental philosophy, and translation theory), the guiding light in these inquiries has always been the same concern with the political functions of literature amidst the permanent crises of modernity.",unknown
i am currently in the process of exploring some new directions in my research as i have been doing more and more work in the fields of media philosophy and new media studies.,unknown
"my first book, the naked communist (fordham up, 2012), explores the ways literature participated in the constitution of the global imaginaries of early-cold war us mainstream culture in the 1950s.",unknown
"by dividing the globe into three separate “worlds,” this cultural imaginary tried to contain a historical crisis that, for the first time in the history of the west, threatened the entire globe with the real possibility of human extinction.",unknown
i tried to demonstrate that in this historical context the idea of “modernism” was reconfigured to provide an ideological justification for a specific type of post-colonial imperialism whose long-term effects are still detectable today.,unknown
the conclusions of this book set me on a broader research agenda that i am currently exploring in my current work.,unknown
"my second monograph, worldlessness after heidegger (edinburgh up, 2020), examines the way the concept of “worldlessness” has emerged in 20 th -century continental philosophy as the standard name for the epochal catastrophe that supposedly threatens us all with the loss of our humanity.",unknown
"according to this intellectual tradition, technological development, imperialism, globalization, the generalization of war-like conditions over the globe, and the looming threat of ecological disaster have created a historical situation in which humanity is simultaneously ever more technologically connected and is increasingly incapable of constructing a shared common “world.” this lost sense of a shared community, then, supposedly explains the rise of authoritarian political tendencies today.",unknown
"the book argues that some of the most influential intellectual innovations of the 20 th century like phenomenology, psychoanalysis, and deconstruction should be seen as fundamentally political responses to this historical situation and calls for affirmative definitions of “worldlessness.” in addition to traditional forms of academic literary and cultural criticism, i am also deeply committed to editing and translation.",unknown
i got involved with editing while i was still a graduate student at suny/buffalo.,unknown
i have always considered these opportunities to have been foundational experiences of my education as they showed me the force and necessity of creating intellectual communities around pressing contemporary questions.,unknown
"the book series, provocations , that i co-edit with marco abel for the university of nebraska press was conceived in the same spirit as it publishes short polemical interventions into contemporary academic debates.",unknown
"my theoretical interest in translation has always been rooted in the practice of translation, which has been my constant preoccupations for the entirety of my academic career.",unknown
"since it is impossible to separate the theory from the actual experience of translation, over the years i have also specialized in the translation of continental philosophy and critical theory.",unknown
"i am the translator and co-translator of three books: rodolphe gasché’s georges bataille: phenomenology and phantasmatology (stanford university press, 2012), peter szendy’s all ears: the aesthetics of espionage (fordham university press, 2017), and fethi benslama’s thinking revolution: writings on insubmission (co-translated with nathan gorelick, forthcoming from bloomsbury).",unknown

"much of his previous research has focused on medieval and early modern literature, with his passion for that topic having begun in an undergraduate english class on british culture.",unknown
"recently, he has done research on writing center studies and says an important overall undercurrent for his work is play.",unknown
"“i am an avid tabletop and video game player with some sports experience (bowling, fencing), and i occasionally bounce ideas off of game studies to see what sticks.",unknown
"in short, i find myself frequently thinking about reading and writing as a player, looking to see what i can do with them,” howard said.",unknown
the professional field of academia is nothing new to howard.,unknown
"his mother and two of his three siblings are teachers, while his father works as a trainer.",unknown
their influence has been a source of inspiration.,unknown
"“uga has more to explore than i'm used to: more coffee shops, more sections in its libraries, more quiet buildings and reading spots, more lunch destinations.",unknown
"that is not to mention the many lovely people - students, colleagues - i've met and continue to meet,” he said.",unknown
"the most powerful part, overall, of academia and english for howard is the human connection, in fact.",unknown

"i knew that, if i could center my work on that, i could keep doing it for a long, long time.”",unknown
"if you have ever taken a yoga class, you may have heard an instructor use the term “find your edge,” referring to the place where comfort meets discomfort.",unknown

"budgets, travel logistics, health and safety planning, and student recruitment – the nuts and bolts of creating a study away program were complicated and, at times, frustrating.",unknown
"before they knew it, the time had come to depart athens and they set off, arriving at st. helena island, sc for their penn center residency.",unknown
"but this foundation proved critical as the group moved on to their next destinations to learn more about the work that happens in uga facilities like the marine education center and shellfish research lab on skidaway island, the uga marine institute on sapelo island, and the marex field station in brunswick.",unknown
"and all the while, they wrote - their own stories inspired by their travels, and stories of people and seafood that illuminate marex’s critical work supporting coastal communities.",unknown
the opportunity to get outside the comfort of park hall proved invaluable.,unknown
gruszczinski sums it up well: “writing and community on the ga coast reminded me how much literature and storytelling can genuinely have an impact.,unknown
"a fter a year and a half of being a student in the english department, i am embarrassed to admit that i sometimes still get lost in park hall.",unknown
"with its well-worn staircases and confusing floorplan, i know i am not the only one.",unknown
"park hall certainly isn’t the flashiest or most sensical building, but there is a reason to its madness.",unknown
its history explains some of its mystery.,unknown
part of why park hall is so weird is partly due to its age.,unknown
"as a part of president franklin delano roosevelt’s new deal, the public works administration constructed park hall in 1939. park hall—the most up-to-date building at the time—was part of a uga expansion plan that also included the construction of leconte hall and baldwin hall.",unknown
"before it was home to the english department, park hall contained the department of physics.",unknown
"during uga’s growth spurt in the 1960s, the university planned to add an annex to park hall to provide additional space and new technology for its students and teachers.",unknown
the annex was completed in 1970 and also provided women’s restrooms—that’s why they’re all on one side of the building!,unknown
"now, park hall houses both the english and classics departments.",unknown
"in 1946, the building was named after the late robert emory park, who served as the english department head from 1900-1942 (yes, you read that correctly!).",unknown
but information about robert park is scant.,unknown
"even his great-grandson, richard stephen (steve) monday, has found difficulty in learning about his ancestor.",unknown
"when he returned home, he attended the university of alabama, where he received a.b.",unknown

this year has seen a wave of centenary celebrations commemorating the avant-garde movement known as dada.,unknown
"one of the dadaists accused art of being “a large-scale swindle.” the swindle was not financial, but ethical.",unknown
"“the dadaist considers it necessary to come out against art, because he has seen through its fraud as a moral safety valve.” accordingly, “dada is forever the enemy of that comfortable sunday art which is supposed to uplift man by reminding him of agreeable moments.” this sounds severe, yet it’s demonstrably the case that dada won (“dada siegt” was a common rallying cry: dada triumphs), at least in the art world.",unknown
"“i cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation of a true expression,” quipped henry david thoreau in walden, a book rife with semantic shenanigans.",unknown
"no wonder (one might be tempted to observe) people are wary of literature and art, both of which flamboyantly refuse to comply with heartfelt sentiments and good taste.",unknown
we are now deep into one of those periodically recurring features of american life in which there’s a seismic shift in focus by students and their families.,unknown
"in its aggregate form, this is known as a flight from the humanities.",unknown
"what this pattern reveals is that education (besides being, well, education) is a bet, a wager on the future.",unknown
"do you put your chips on the roulette wheel options of english, or engineering, studio art, animal husbandry, pharmacy?",unknown
these contested numbers reflect well on our department.,unknown
"it means we deliver the goods, as the saying has it.",unknown
but what are the goods?,unknown
"in the old-timey school formula—reading, writing, and ’rithmetic—we deliver two of the three.",unknown
but it’s not that simple.,unknown
"there’s also a lot of history that comes into play (after all, history is not exclusive to the history department any more than written english is exclusive to us).",unknown
"and there’s psychology, and sociology, and philosophy, and … but why enumerate, when the fact is that literature encompasses anything and everything?",unknown
one thing that literature definitely does not do is pander to your own views and biases.,unknown
"i wouldn’t normally have listed grief counseling among the services we provide, but i’m not surprised that it has come to that.",unknown
"what this phenomenon reflects is the fact that in english classes students are being constantly exposed to the light and the dark of human endeavor, the sad and the happy, viciousness and beneficence, pluck and luck.",unknown
"there is no preordained response to the books we read, but there’s almost always a response, because stories and novels, poems and plays make a claim on us.",unknown
"collectively, it’s called literature not because it has “passed the test of time” but because it doesn’t claim attention as merchandise.",unknown
"we don’t read what we read because it’s popular (moby-dick was such a flop it effectively ended melville’s career as a writer, but many would now list it as their favorite book, including me).",unknown
"we read these things because they provide access to another world that is strangely like this world yet, like alice going into wonderland, once we’re inside we’re likely to find ourselves bemused, horrified, delighted, indifferent, but always learning.",unknown
the appetite for learning is what all the humanities provide.,unknown
"that can put a real damper on the learning process, which then feels like studying up for a driver’s license.",unknown
"the humanities give us something altogether different, and i’d put it this way: you can never pass the test.",unknown
i’ll end with a haunting provocation from robert frost.,unknown
but here’s where it gets interesting.,unknown
"“i’ve been thinking lately that politics is an extravagance,” he suggests, “an extravagance about grievances.",unknown
and poetry is an extravagance about grief.,unknown
"and grievances are something that can be remedied, and griefs are irremediable, you know.",unknown
"once again, spring has come — and gone already, having arrived as early as january.",unknown
"“that’s true,” i replied.",unknown
"of eighty-three classes, only eight had gender parity, while twenty-nine had a ratio of 10 to 1 (female to male).",unknown
retirements tell the story.,unknown
"this year we bade farewell to doug anderson, simon gatrell, and fred dolezal, who were preceded in retirement last year by hugh ruppersburg and charlie doyle.",unknown
"in fact, the only woman who has retired in the past eight years was the late judith ortiz cofer.",unknown
"and so it is fitting that the next department head will be michelle ballif, who will succeed me in august.",unknown
"but gender disparity in english means there’s disparity elsewhere, and this has the potential to replicate old stereotypes in worrisome ways.",unknown
"if the “hard” sciences and the “worldly” schools like business and engineering are predominately male, a tacit signal seeps out from the university, suggesting that some fields, like literary studies, have become a kind of “woman’s work.” such social maladjustments are reflected in the even more worrisome statistics about the profession.",unknown
these figures are alarming.,unknown
"fortunately, they are not replicated here at the university of georgia, but a single institution can’t hold out forever against national trends.",unknown
"fortunately, congress did not accept his recommendation, but the threat remains.",unknown
hard times is one thing; extinction is something else altogether.,unknown
"a classic of american history is richard hofstadter’s 1963 book anti-intellectualism in american life , with its bracing chronicle of everything you’d imagine from the title.",unknown
"but hofstadter was sensitive to the fact that the united states, as a democracy, has always needed to audition alternative voices, other perspectives; the intellectuals had no guaranteed stake in the outcome of public issues.",unknown
"but in times like these, we intellectuals occupy an increasingly precarious ground, recently made even more precarious in georgia by the governor’s signing into law the “campus carry” bill permitting concealed weapons on campus.",unknown
"it gives the phrase “special interests” a whole new profile, doesn’t it?",unknown
"we have legitimate interests as well, but apparently not special enough to count .",unknown
"we teach the whole complex world depicted in literary works, in which it’s clear that the skullduggery we face in the world today is nothing new.",unknown
"but it’s worth knowing there is historical precedent; it’s important to have access to other minds in other times, contending with the same traumas that seem so unprecedented today.",unknown
"“to read aeschylus or shakespeare—let alone to ‘teach’ them—as if the texts, as if the authority of the texts in our own lives, were immune from recent history, is subtle but corrosive illiteracy.”",unknown
"“i don’t know,” i had to admit.",unknown
what greek sophist is this statue representing?” i had no idea.,unknown
a long silence was my immediate response.,unknown
"as the proverbial deer in headlights, i could only stare back blankly, and then, finally, when the dead silence became too heavy, mumble, “i don’t know.” “demosthenes,” she announced to the class, and i registered her disappointment; i had been introduced to the class as a scholar of the sophists.",unknown
"yet in defense of my ignorance, i quickly told myself, had she given me a text , such as “on the crown,” i might have had a fighting chance to respond differently.",unknown
"however, years later, i still feel a need to defend my ignorance.",unknown
yet isn’t “not knowing” precisely the reason for being a student?,unknown
"indeed, wasn’t that the reason that i chose to become an apprentice of classical art and architecture, so that i could learn what i didn’t know?",unknown
"as my primary discipline is rhetorical theory, i wanted to study in a second discipline—that of ancient art and aesthetics.",unknown
"my aim was to follow my desire to examine resonances between the principles of ancient rhetoric and ancient aesthetics, including principles of symmetry, perspective, proportion.",unknown
"so i found myself in the position of a student, humbled by my ignorance.",unknown
"we are, all of us, students.",unknown
you might say that being a student is our profession.,unknown
"we are students of language, of texts; it is our profession to engage with that which we don’t know.",unknown
"they need direction, they need to learn the tricks of using a complex system, and they need to know the protocol.",unknown
and of admitting it.,unknown
and of embracing it.,unknown
"indeed, i am suggesting that for all of us, being a student is to acknowledge the limits of our knowledge, to extend a gesture of hospitality toward the unknown, and to state without embarrassment, “i don’t know.” passionate learners make effective teachers.",unknown
he has accomplished this first through his passion for the subject-matter he teaches and his ability to transfer this passion to his students.,unknown
"his teaching style encourages students to wrestle with the most challenging questions of the texts, teaching us to ask these questions ourselves in our own readings.",unknown
we are also grateful for our other donors who provide support to our students.,unknown
"we hope their generosity inspires you, and we hope that you consider contributing to the english department’s threefold mission of teaching, research, and community research.",unknown

"but i have incorporated this scholarly play into my classroom, to encourage a sense of adventure, to underscore how interpretive strategies can be employed variously, in order to provide rich readings of texts.",unknown
"i call this exercise the “lit crit blowout.” at least, i smile.",unknown
"the point of this message is to highlight the intellect, curiosity, and ingenuity of our students.",unknown
"one of these “literary theory” students, astra taylor, went on to write several books, including examined life and an accompanying dvd of the same title, which interviews key theorists and asks them—as the title suggests—how concerns of justice, truth, and meaning, for example, inflect our readings.",unknown
"of our graduates this year, i have had the pleasure of learning from the interpretive work of students including keamber farley, alex williams, ellen everitt, lukas woodyard, rachel dier, mk manoylov, and julia koslowsky.",unknown
but many more students have graced my rolls over the years.,unknown

welcome to 2020!,unknown
"and, although not an official anniversary, this new decade marks, roughly, the advent of the department of english at the university of georgia, approximately one hundred years ago.",unknown
"in a reaction to a national controversy over the value of teaching literature in the “mother tongue of our everyday life,” georgia’s board of trustees voted in the late 1800s that the teaching of english should be given more prominence, and so finally our community of scholars and students was given official sanction, as well as the institutional support to sustain us.",unknown
"over the past 100 years, we’ve grown in size, stature, and scope, offering much to support the study of “belles lettres,” that is characteristic of the department of english.",unknown
"dear friends and colleagues of the english department: whether an overstatement, understatement, or an example of hyperbole or litotes, it can be said that this fall semester was not.",unknown
"joshua king and caroline young detail in their featured note about teaching in prisons, or how students discuss their experiences learning to adjust to new pedagogical environments.",unknown
"we send all best wishes for a hopeful 2021—full of promise, joy, and health for all.",unknown
"their contributions to our department, to the university, and the greater profession have been many, and they will be sorely missed.",unknown
"additionally, i want to acknowledge all of our donors.",unknown
we express our deep appreciation to all our current—and—future donors.,unknown
both have served the department with dedication during the past six years in their respective administrative positions of associate head and undergraduate coordinator.,unknown
"the work done in such administrative positions, along with the work of their support staff, is often invisible, but is essential to ensuring the conditions of possibility for our individual and collective success.",unknown
"as part of our core mission statement, the department of english is proud to offer students “a sympathetic participation in the verbal worlds of other times and places, drawing on the full range of linguistic tools, historic knowledge, and interpretive experience at our disposal.” aiming to “allow our students to enhance their appreciation of expressive possibility,” we hope to develop “a sophisticated, practical grasp of the central role that language plays in the preservation of human institutions”—and relations, i would add.",unknown
"these theories also invite ethical implications for how one chooses to “be in the world.” we each make many choices every day, but choices always have consequences.",unknown
"one of the theorists we read, martha nussbaum, for example, discussed the importance of mutual care as a foundation for justice.",unknown
"to me, this idea highlights the lived experience that we are each brought into this world, absolutely dependent on the care of others.",unknown
"as a corollary, subsequently, we have the responsibility for others, as well.",unknown
"as many of you don’t know, i live on a farm, and i well know the responsibilities of caring for, nurturing, and sustaining all under my care.",unknown
"this “response-ability,” as scholar diane davis notes, means we have an ethical obligation to respond to the other, insofar as we are able.",unknown
"we respond when anyone calls us—not necessarily in a moment of distress, but when someone says our name or when a stranger hails us.",unknown
"that is: when called, even metaphorically, i turn; i respond , as responsibly as i am able, because i acknowledge that there are many who have nurtured me and provided opportunity for me.",unknown
this response becomes the answer to the call to be responsible to these others.,unknown
"all best, michelle ballif",unknown

"to all of you, i say ""begin afresh, afresh, afresh.""",unknown
"well, that was a whirlwind!",unknown
"my first semester as interim head is now in the books, and i could not be more grateful for the experience.",unknown
"rather, it is a collective endeavor, an ever-evolving community of students, teachers, researchers, staff, and administrators, all of whom—without exception--are passionately dedicated to the study of language and writing.",unknown

"it was spread through england, but instead of being written in old english, it was written in french.",unknown
"it is this type of syncretism of languages, literatures, and cultures that is so fascinating to dr. mattison.",unknown

he died in 2019…i’m writing it for him.,unknown
i’m not writing it for me.,unknown
"i want his reputation to be larger than it is now and have more people reading him.” as dr. lowe prepares for retirement, he looks back on his career while looking forward to the legacies that he wants to leave.",unknown
"he hopes that his teaching has left students not only with the “skills to better understand the value of literature,” but also the skills “to make them better citizens.” he believes that “literature often gives you guideposts for life,” which helps students become better (literary) citizens in the world through what they read.",unknown
"he is “proud of [his] legacy with graduate students,” having directed twenty-nine dissertations throughout his career.",unknown

"many of us in the room immediately assented, having felt that there was a lack of undergraduate community within park hall.",unknown
"to many, this was the chance to form a true community, where english undergraduate students could share resources, develop camaraderie, and plan their futures beyond the arch together.",unknown
"so when spring semester came, that same group of students reconvened, and broke ground on building the new english undergraduate association.",unknown
"they held an election, selecting a president, vice-president, and other essential board members, and made a list of goals for the semester.",unknown
one of the most important initiatives spearheaded by the undergraduate english association was opening a study hall within park hall.,unknown

"for him, game design is about choice and creating experiences for the player in the same way that texts implement specific rhetorical choices to shape a certain experience for the reader.",unknown
"when “you’re reading, you’re having the experience based on the words someone else wrote,” an experience “designed” by the writer.",unknown
"“games do the same thing” because “when you’re playing a game, you’re having fun or you’re being frustrated or you’re competing with people because of rules that someone else made.” while “a read experience is kind of quiet.",unknown
"it’s so internalized, and reading is so familiar that we really don’t think about it,” “playing a game is a loud experience” that demonstrates how choice “create[s] experiences” that “move us.” even as he strives to revitalize rhetoric for students through video games, he notes that in many respects, his game-based writing classroom is still “a traditional writing and rhetoric class,” though you will see students playing games such as the stanley parable and what remains of edith finch .",unknown
"students learn about the writing process, rhetorical devices, and academic research as they discuss texts such as richard lamb’s economies of attention and shira chess’s ready player two.",unknown
what “sets this [class] apart from all other ones” is his decision to give students the whole semester to design their games instead of only 4-6 weeks.,unknown
"he was prepared to “stop doing studio mondays if it stops being productive,” but “it never did.” every monday, students were “doing amazing, impressive things.",unknown
"the most constructive move that writing instructors can make, dr. king suggests, is “defamiliarizing” the familiar for students.",unknown
"he “defamiliarizes rhetoric” through game-playing, urging students to question what it means to play a game and read a text or to design a game and write a text.",unknown
"there is value, he contends, in teaching writing “unconventionally” and “approaching it from [a] different angle” because an unfamiliar approach “takes this thing that we think is really normal and boring, like writing and reading and…dramatizes the fact that it’s not normal or boring at all.",unknown
"in that way, defamiliarizing rhetoric simultaneously foregrounds how familiar rhetoric is by emphasizing how much our daily lives are “surrounded” by it.",unknown
"as students realize how “language moves us,” the fact that language moves the world and that we “move” language daily becomes tangibly, powerfully ordinary.",unknown
"for dr. king, the first year writing classroom is a space in which the normal becomes as defamiliarized as it is familiarized.",unknown
only then can we “keep limber” our experiences of language.,unknown

"“it’s something i’ll miss,” she says.",unknown

she continued to teach austen and 18th and 19th century british literature.,unknown
"twenty-nine years later, she’s held positions in administration: two terms as the undergraduate coordinator, one as social media coordinator, and most recently she was associate head for two years.",unknown
"no matter what position she held, though, dr. eberle always maintained her passion for teaching.",unknown
she says that one of the things she’ll miss most is the moments of unique insight and discovery that can only be found in the classroom.,unknown
"“there are just moments of pure joy,” she says.",unknown
"moments where she introduces a student to a novel or poem, and they have an insight that “blows my mind.” there are funny moments too; for example, when a student titled an essay “samuel taylor coleridge, the drug addict” after she had mentioned his addiction to laudanum in passing.",unknown
"dr. eberle felt it was an important lesson for her future teaching philosophies, which are largely informed by making sure students have proper context and biography, so that they can better engage with and understand the work.",unknown
"later in her career, dr. eberle feels fortunate to have been able to mentor a host of wonderful graduate students.",unknown
"“watching them grow and flourish has been really important—truly priceless,” she says.",unknown
paralleling her love of teaching is dr. eberle’s love of books.,unknown
"“i got my first purse when i was eight, and i got it solely for the purpose of keeping books in there,” she says, laughing.",unknown
"while she loved—and still loves—virginia woolf and the well-known writers of that period, she “[loves] the detective work of learning about these women writers, who had been so well-known in their period, but completely forgotten with time.” after 29 years at uga, though, dr. eberle is looking forward to the future.",unknown
"“i’ve loved every minute, but i’m also pretty excited about the next stage,” she says.",unknown
"in california, where dr. eberle plans to move with her husband, waits a sizable family, and her daughter, who is finishing her last year at berkeley.",unknown

"roland was born to an intellectually driven family mostly composed of mathematicians and engineers in nyíregyháza, hungary in the midst of the cold war.",unknown
"although his family encouraged him to follow in their footsteps, roland found that literature provided a way to imagine life outside of the historical circumstances he grew up in.",unknown

"“the nuns used work and specifically artistic creation as a form of mediation and prayer,” she says.",unknown
"“and they were aware of this concept of flow…and why they were doing their art.” her passion derives from the fact that this undiscussed history rebukes much of the common perceptions about middle-age women, which often characterize them as isolated and having little intelligent thought, much less artistic ability.",unknown

"fullerton’s recreation of thoreau’s concord and walden pond is more classical, virtual and even cinematic, a paradoxically technological transcendentalism of play focused on the observing subject.",unknown
"conversely, reihana’s more explicitly panoramic work about the cook expeditions, which emerges from ‘polynesian’ auckland, suggests in its layers and reenactments a more distributed and indeed augmented agency in the pacific when compared with the ‘atlantic world.’ why walden pond might appear more virtual and a pacific island more augmented can be better understood by returning to the archives of two print-age pacific expeditions by james cook and george macartney.",unknown
such media objects indicate the use of a more consciously panoramic approach to counter anxiety over erratic failures of mastery and masculinity in a revolutionary age.,unknown

"the esol sections, like classes for native speakers, focus on writing academic argument in english 1101 and writing about literature in english 1102. first-year writing classes for esol offer non-native speakers opportunities for vocabulary development, for grammar practice, and for orientation to american styles of writing and organization.",unknown
"residents of the united states whose first language is not american english, as well as international students, may qualify for these classes.",unknown
"students in 1102e meet all the standard fyw engl1102 requirements while completing a series of units (or ""modules"").",unknown
"students work as a cohort between specified dates, but do not meet as a group during particular class times, either online or face-to-face.",unknown
experienced instructors may design a special topics version of fyw that is approved in advance by the first-year writing committee.,unknown
the ultimate goal of service-learning is to promote students' civic and academic learning while contributing to the public good.,unknown
"fyw digital learning labs: park 117, 118, 119 the fyw digital learning labs are located on the first floor of the new wing in park hall.",unknown
lab 118 is open to students and instructors every week day 8:00-5:00 m-f for performing elw-related tasks such as uploading and peer reviewing and for technical assistance with elw.,unknown
we have two labs designated as teaching spaces: a limited number of laptops will be available for checkout for use in the labs during the class period.,unknown
students must bring their uga id card to lab 118 to check out a laptop.,unknown
guidelines for writing the introductory reflective essay (rtf) portfolio grading rubric (rtf) the portfolio project helps you develop into a proficient writer by offering you multiple opportunities to practice and demonstrate to others your mastery of writing as an art.,unknown
"in this class, students will write a minimum of three graded papers plus other pieces of writing assigned by the teacher.",unknown
"for both students and teachers, portfolios offer many advantages over other forms of assessment.",unknown
"first-and probably most important, from the student’s point of view-writers gain more control over their writing and therefore over their grades.",unknown
"instead of demonstrating your skill in a single essay, the final examination, you will create, select, revise and polish different pieces for the portfolio throughout the semester.",unknown
"within boundaries established by the first-year writing program, you select the pieces to include in your portfolio; you will have opportunities to consult with your teacher and peers about the portfolio’s contents and to revise those pieces you choose to include; finally, you will have an opportunity to explain the merits of your portfolio as part of the assessment process.",unknown
"for the same reasons, teachers also like this method of evaluation: including portfolios in writing assessment allows them to focus on revision, on improvement, and on a process of collaboration among student, teacher, and peers.",unknown
what is in the portfolio?,unknown
"as stated in the fyw handbook , students in the first-year writing program write a minimum of three graded papers.",unknown
"for your final assessment, you will compose and submit for evaluation an electronic portfolio that includes the following seven components: a biography of the portfolio author and, if you like, a picture of yourself or other image.",unknown
"the biography should provide a short introduction to you, the author of the portfolio.",unknown
you may include a photo of yourself or an image that relates to ideas discussed in your portfolio.,unknown
the goal of your biography should be to introduce yourself as a writer .,unknown
the introductory reflective essay.,unknown
"the most important element in your portfolio, the introductory reflective essay (ire) (usually 750-1500 words) ties together all the exhibits in your portfolio; it helps you describe and reflect on your writing processes, with your exhibits providing the supporting evidence .",unknown
"these pieces provide evidence of your best critical thinking, argumentative strategies, prose style, and editing skills.",unknown
they represent your most “finished” pieces of writing.,unknown
one revision exhibit that demonstrates your composing process and revision skills.,unknown
"for this exhibit, students typically present a portion of a paper (e.g., a paragraph or the thesis statement); and demonstrate the development of this piece of writing through several drafts.",unknown
your task is to clearly show how your writing changed between drafts and to include explaining commentary on your revision process to readers.,unknown
one peer review exhibit that demonstrates your work in reviewing or responding to the work of other writers.,unknown
"again, your task is to demonstrate the quality of your work and to explain your peer review process.",unknown
one wild card submission.,unknown
some students create new exhibits especially to fit with their portfolio theme.,unknown
"in thinking about selecting or creating a wild card, consider how it fits into your overall portfolio rationale.",unknown
there are resources describing the process of submitting a portfolio in elc: a video and a text document.,unknown
"the first-year writing program at uga introduces 4,500-5,000 students a year to college-level academic writing.",unknown
"eportfolios allow students to showcase their best work, to reflect upon their own writing practices, and to present their writing in a persuasive manner to a range of readers.",unknown
the uga first year writing program was a member of cohort 2 of the inter/national coalition of electronic portfolio research and in 2007 submitted a final report to that body.,unknown
"in 2010-2013, the fyw program participated in cohort 6 of the inter/national coalition of electronic portfolio research; the research topic was assessment.",unknown
"a collaboration between the uga writing center, division of biology, first-year writing, and the writing intensive program, the project involved a study of how advanced humanities writers respond to biology lab reports in order to isolate science writing knowledge gaps (2018).",unknown
the first-year writing program uses technology to help students develop their written communication.,unknown
among these tools is elearning for writers (elw).,unknown
most university students will take english 1101 and 1102 during their first year at uga.,unknown
"complete information about placement is available on the ""credit from testing"" page on the registrar’s website .",unknown
students who earn a score of 3 or 4 on the national advanced language placement test in literature receive three hours of credit for english 1101; those who earn a score of 5 receive six hours of credit for english 1101 and 1102. all ap equivalencies are available on the registrar’s website .,unknown
"2. the international baccalaureate (ib) program: students who earn a score of 4, 5, or 6 on the international baccalaureate exam at the high level (hl) in english receive three hours of credit for english 1101; those who earn a score of 7 on the international baccalaureate exam at the high level (hl) receive six hours of credit for english 1101 and 1102. students who earn a score of 5, 6, or 7 on the standard level (sl) test receive three hours of credit for english 1101. all ib equivalencies are available on the registrar’s website.",unknown
"students with an evidence based reading & writing (formerly known as satv) score of 590 and above or an act score of 26 or above will place automatically in engl 1101 and may register for that class without any further testing; if these students choose to do so, they may take the departmental placement exam voluntarily with an eye to exempting engl 1101 with three hours of credit.",unknown
students with an ebrw (formerly known as satv) score of 580 or below are required to take the departmental placement exam before registering for a first-year writing class.,unknown
specific information about the departmental english placement exam can be found at the testing services website's page on the exam.,unknown
"the departmental english placement test consists of two parts, mechanics and rhetoric.",unknown
a score of 22 (part 1) and 20 (part 2) will place students in english 1102 and give them three hours of credit for english 1101. students whose test scores indicate that they might have trouble in english 1101 will write an essay to determine whether they will be advised to take english 1101 or an academic enhancement class.,unknown
students should take the test at a first-year orientation session.,unknown
those who miss the test at orientation may take it later at university testing services in clark howell hall.,unknown
"however, the test is not open to students who have taken or are currently enrolled in first-year writing here or elsewhere.",unknown
"for more information, please call (706) 542-3183 or visit the university testing service website .",unknown
"because writing skills develop slowly over time and because in-class activities are crucial to the discussion-based format of the class and its community-building mission, students’ regular attendance is important in first-year writing.",unknown
instructors are neither required nor expected to re-teach material covered in class to students who were absent.,unknown
it is the responsibility of the student to have sco send a message to their instructor verifying the severity of the situation.,unknown
"beyond what is described above, the only other excused absences are those listed under uga policy 4.06, jury duty, military service, and religious observances.",unknown
students incur no grade penalties for un-excused absences 1-6 (for classes that meet mwf) or un-excused absences 1-4 (for mw and tth classes).,unknown
it is the instructor’s responsibility to judge work and assign grades.,unknown
"consequently, students with questions about final grades should first discuss those questions with their instructors.",unknown
"the appeal to the instructor should contain a cover letter explaining the grounds for the appeal, and providing all relevant supporting documentation.",unknown
"3) if, after appealing to the instructor, the student is not satisfied, they may appeal to the fyw program director, per department of english bylaws.",unknown
the university assigns certain grades that are not computed in the grade point average.,unknown
the incomplete (“i”) is one of these.,unknown
students who receive incompletes may have no longer than three semesters to complete all remaining work satisfactorily.,unknown
instructors can require that students complete work in a shorter period of time.,unknown
"if an “i” is not removed after three terms (including summer), it changes to an “f.” incompletes are assigned sparingly and at the discretion of the instructor and the director of the first-year writing program when a small amount of essential work remains.",unknown
"with your help, we can expand our intellectual vibrancy and make the university of georgia the south's literary center.",unknown
this option allows donors to make regular payments through eft from their banking institutions or by way of credit card charges.,unknown
"if you have questions about engl 1101/1102 or the first year writing program, please visit the first year writing website .",unknown
"at the core of our discipline lie the complex skills of reading and writing, and though these can be productively applied to a wide range of professional goals our own work as scholars and teachers strives to deepen our understanding of the critical and creative imagination.",unknown
"a sympathetic participation in the verbal worlds of other times and places, drawing on the full range of linguistic tools, historical knowledge, and interpretive experience at our disposal, allows our students to enhance their appreciation for expressive possibility.",unknown

abstract: modern content management systems make it easy to build web-based repositories or digital libraries.,unknown
"such systems often allow the user to create new content types consisting of any number of named fields; the fields might contain simple values (attributes), references to other content type instances (relationships), or references to files.",unknown
"even when using the same content management system, repositories can differ in structure: some repositories may have a single content type (e.g.,resource) with associated metadata fields (e.g., dublin core metadata fields).",unknown
"other repositories may define multiple content types, connected by relationships.",unknown
"our approach begins with the definition of small schema fragments that we call domain structures, where the domain structure describes (just) what is needed to support a widget of interest.",unknown
"for example, in order to support a hierarchical navigation widget, we use a domain structure with one entity (resource) with a single attribute (title), with a recursive relationship (part-of) that relates resources.",unknown
"given a domain structure, we ask domain-savvy end-users to define simple correspondences from the components of the domain structure to their local structure.",unknown
"in effective, we seek to support end-user schema mapping.",unknown
"we have implemented these ideas in the drupal content management system; we host several educational repositories with generic widgets that support navigation, (selective) cloning and downloading.",unknown
"we have extended this work by defining a domain structure that supports dynamic, compound faceted browsing for repositories with simple structure.",unknown

"farms once staffed by humans to bring produce from the field to stores for purchase were suddenly short-staffed, and the global supply chain was severely impacted.",unknown
"working with uga’s vidalia onion and vegetable research center , a unit of the college of agricultural and environmental sciences , and a&m farms in lyons, georgia, they have tested a robotic arm in the task of sorting fresh vidalia onions from those suffering blemishes.",unknown
"combining a robotic arm with cameras and an ai trained to recognize the good and bad produce, the system can pick up onions, view it, and sort the good from the bad.",unknown
the project has shown progress in a type of task known as “pick-inspect-place.” robots in agriculture or manufacturing have long been involved in picking and placing tasks.,unknown
"here, researchers have added the element of inspecting using computer vision, as well.",unknown
“there’s one that teaches the robot the behavior and one that detects the object using vision.,unknown
"the second ai model will detect the object and instruct the proper behavior—r inspection for blemishes on good onions or throwing blemished onions in the waste.” the idea, doshi said, is not to eliminate these professions for human workers, but to provide options, protect the job from labor shortages and to upskill workers into positions that require less strenuous conditions.",unknown
"“often, these workers work through high heat, dust, or other conditions,” he said.",unknown
“we are not trying to replace this worker.,unknown
