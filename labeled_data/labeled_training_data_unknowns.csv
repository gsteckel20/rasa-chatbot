i am currently in the process of exploring some new directions in my research as i have been doing more and more work in the fields of media philosophy and new media studies.,unknown
"my first book, the naked communist (fordham up, 2012), explores the ways literature participated in the constitution of the global imaginaries of early-cold war us mainstream culture in the 1950s.",unknown
"by dividing the globe into three separate “worlds,” this cultural imaginary tried to contain a historical crisis that, for the first time in the history of the west, threatened the entire globe with the real possibility of human extinction.",unknown
i tried to demonstrate that in this historical context the idea of “modernism” was reconfigured to provide an ideological justification for a specific type of post-colonial imperialism whose long-term effects are still detectable today.,unknown
the conclusions of this book set me on a broader research agenda that i am currently exploring in my current work.,unknown
"my second monograph, worldlessness after heidegger (edinburgh up, 2020), examines the way the concept of “worldlessness” has emerged in 20 th -century continental philosophy as the standard name for the epochal catastrophe that supposedly threatens us all with the loss of our humanity.",unknown
"according to this intellectual tradition, technological development, imperialism, globalization, the generalization of war-like conditions over the globe, and the looming threat of ecological disaster have created a historical situation in which humanity is simultaneously ever more technologically connected and is increasingly incapable of constructing a shared common “world.” this lost sense of a shared community, then, supposedly explains the rise of authoritarian political tendencies today.",unknown
"the book argues that some of the most influential intellectual innovations of the 20 th century like phenomenology, psychoanalysis, and deconstruction should be seen as fundamentally political responses to this historical situation and calls for affirmative definitions of “worldlessness.” in addition to traditional forms of academic literary and cultural criticism, i am also deeply committed to editing and translation.",unknown
i got involved with editing while i was still a graduate student at suny/buffalo.,unknown
i have always considered these opportunities to have been foundational experiences of my education as they showed me the force and necessity of creating intellectual communities around pressing contemporary questions.,unknown
"the book series, provocations , that i co-edit with marco abel for the university of nebraska press was conceived in the same spirit as it publishes short polemical interventions into contemporary academic debates.",unknown
"my theoretical interest in translation has always been rooted in the practice of translation, which has been my constant preoccupations for the entirety of my academic career.",unknown
"since it is impossible to separate the theory from the actual experience of translation, over the years i have also specialized in the translation of continental philosophy and critical theory.",unknown
"i am the translator and co-translator of three books: rodolphe gasché’s georges bataille: phenomenology and phantasmatology (stanford university press, 2012), peter szendy’s all ears: the aesthetics of espionage (fordham university press, 2017), and fethi benslama’s thinking revolution: writings on insubmission (co-translated with nathan gorelick, forthcoming from bloomsbury).",unknown

dr sargan's research occupies three overlapping spheres.,unknown
"his first book project, reading early middle english books , is invested the multiplicity of partial literacies exhibited by readers of manuscripts from 1066–1300.",unknown
"in it he uses critical approaches to non-verbal evidence—marks, dirt, and the haptics of binding—to show that reading was a social act that extended the written word to those far beyond the limits of traditional considerations of literacy.",unknown
his interest in the haptics and handling of books lead to dr sargan’s work investigating binding structures using scientific imaging.,unknown
"collaborations on this research have produced proof on concept studies on the use of micro-ct in researching no longer extant binding structures (published in digital philology , 2022); the use of such imaging for conservation planning and decision making (in preparation, care and conservation of manuscripts ); and the visualization of medieval fragments reused in the production of early modern bindings.",unknown
"finally, both of these research areas have been a prompt to critical thinking about methodology.",unknown
"dr sargan’s second book project, trans histories of the medieval book: experiments in bibliography (forthcoming 2025), take a theoretical approach to traditional methods in the study of manuscripts, assessing their historical roots in imperialist intellectual traditions and proposes an alternative approach grounded in queer and trans liberation.",unknown

"although dr. kretzschmar is retiring from uga, he is not retiring from his academic life.",unknown
"he plans to continue travelling abroad to europe to give conference papers and teach, especially when he has invitations, like his next one in london this spring.",unknown
"and lastly, he reads a lot.",unknown
"according to his last count, he has over 500 books on his kindle!",unknown
dr. kretzschmar’s favorite hobby is to spend time with his family.,unknown
he recalled how his sons would sometimes accompany him to his job when they were under the weather.,unknown
"fast forward some years later, dr. kretzschmar now spends time with his grandsons.",unknown
it sounds like dr. kretzschmar will have a very cozy retirement with his loved ones.,unknown
"the people of park hall will miss dr. kretzschmar, but we hope he has a restful retirement!",unknown
"he just published his first book, the seduction of pessimism in the novel: eros, failure, and the quarrel with philosophy with lexington books, an imprint of rowman & littlefield / bloomsbury.",unknown
dr. james howard is new to park hall.,unknown
"much of his previous research has focused on medieval and early modern literature, with his passion for that topic having begun in an undergraduate english class on british culture.",unknown
"recently, he has done research on writing center studies and says an important overall undercurrent for his work is play.",unknown
"“i am an avid tabletop and video game player with some sports experience (bowling, fencing), and i occasionally bounce ideas off of game studies to see what sticks.",unknown
"in short, i find myself frequently thinking about reading and writing as a player, looking to see what i can do with them,” howard said.",unknown
the professional field of academia is nothing new to howard.,unknown
"his mother and two of his three siblings are teachers, while his father works as a trainer.",unknown
their influence has been a source of inspiration.,unknown
"“uga has more to explore than i'm used to: more coffee shops, more sections in its libraries, more quiet buildings and reading spots, more lunch destinations.",unknown
"that is not to mention the many lovely people - students, colleagues - i've met and continue to meet,” he said.",unknown
"the most powerful part, overall, of academia and english for howard is the human connection, in fact.",unknown
"“what i value the most in academia is the sense of purpose centered on collaborative, lifelong learning.",unknown
"i knew that, if i could center my work on that, i could keep doing it for a long, long time.”",unknown
"if you have ever taken a yoga class, you may have heard an instructor use the term “find your edge,” referring to the place where comfort meets discomfort.",unknown
"for dr. elizabeth davis and a group of eleven intrepid undergraduates, that phrase captures the essence of their experience in a new domestic field study program, “writing & community at the georgia coast.” developed by dr. davis in collaboration with uga’s marine extension unit, and with support from a 2023 domestic field study fellowship and from the willson center’s culture & community partnership with the penn center historic district, the program was designed to create an immersive learning experience researching and writing in and for coastal communities.",unknown
"while she was in her element developing new academic classes and projects, designing and implementing a study away program pushed davis to her edge.",unknown
"budgets, travel logistics, health and safety planning, and student recruitment – the nuts and bolts of creating a study away program were complicated and, at times, frustrating.",unknown
"but the work came to fruition and the new program began enrolling students for maymester 2024. the class met on campus for the first four days of the term, reading articles and books on the history of the global atlantic, coastal geography and ecology, and oyster aquaculture.",unknown
"before they knew it, the time had come to depart athens and they set off, arriving at st. helena island, sc for their penn center residency.",unknown
"davis was excited to observe her students making themselves at home in the charming dormitories there, playing cards, sharing favorite music and movies, and relaxing at the dock after each busy day’s activities.",unknown
"again, though, davis and her students were pushed from their comfort zones as they absorbed history they had not been taught in school and learned about the ecological and economic challenges that threaten the future of sea island communities.",unknown
"but this foundation proved critical as the group moved on to their next destinations to learn more about the work that happens in uga facilities like the marine education center and shellfish research lab on skidaway island, the uga marine institute on sapelo island, and the marex field station in brunswick.",unknown
"students in the program challenged themselves to do new things: piloting a research vessel in the estuaries, recording data on the marine life hauled up in trawl nets, cooking meals, lugging gear, picking crab and heading shrimp, getting muddy in the salt marsh, and listening intently to community members’ stories of the past and concerns for the future.",unknown
"and all the while, they wrote - their own stories inspired by their travels, and stories of people and seafood that illuminate marex’s critical work supporting coastal communities.",unknown
the opportunity to get outside the comfort of park hall proved invaluable.,unknown
gruszczinski sums it up well: “writing and community on the ga coast reminded me how much literature and storytelling can genuinely have an impact.,unknown
"a fter a year and a half of being a student in the english department, i am embarrassed to admit that i sometimes still get lost in park hall.",unknown
"with its well-worn staircases and confusing floorplan, i know i am not the only one.",unknown
"park hall certainly isn’t the flashiest or most sensical building, but there is a reason to its madness.",unknown
its history explains some of its mystery.,unknown
part of why park hall is so weird is partly due to its age.,unknown
"as a part of president franklin delano roosevelt’s new deal, the public works administration constructed park hall in 1939. park hall—the most up-to-date building at the time—was part of a uga expansion plan that also included the construction of leconte hall and baldwin hall.",unknown
"before it was home to the english department, park hall contained the department of physics.",unknown
"during uga’s growth spurt in the 1960s, the university planned to add an annex to park hall to provide additional space and new technology for its students and teachers.",unknown
the annex was completed in 1970 and also provided women’s restrooms—that’s why they’re all on one side of the building!,unknown
"now, park hall houses both the english and classics departments.",unknown
"in 1946, the building was named after the late robert emory park, who served as the english department head from 1900-1942 (yes, you read that correctly!).",unknown
but information about robert park is scant.,unknown
"even his great-grandson, richard stephen (steve) monday, has found difficulty in learning about his ancestor.",unknown
"thankfully, a 1957 article from the georgia review provides some insight into the park hall namesake: robert emory park was born to emma bailey and james fletcher park in tuskegee on 11 december, 1868. he enrolled in west point military academia in 1888, but resigned after eighteen months due to an injury.",unknown
"when he returned home, he attended the university of alabama, where he received a.b.",unknown
"before he arrived at uga in 1900, park taught at gainsville high schools and married mary belle whelchel, who belonged to a prominent north georgia family.",unknown
"in addition to his forty-year tenure as head of the english department, park studied at oxford university for a year, travelled in europe, and received an honorary doctorate from ua.",unknown
"he was also a member of the methodist church, the democratic party, and several fraternities.",unknown
"the article speaks highly of robert e. park--describing his character as accomplished and disciplined, but gentle-natured.",unknown
he had a warm personality and was dedicated to his students’ education and well-being.,unknown
"like most of his colleagues, he gave little or no time to the composition of scholarly learned journals; he gave his time instead to his reading and to his students” sources: rebecca hopper and akela reason.",unknown

this year has seen a wave of centenary celebrations commemorating the avant-garde movement known as dada.,unknown
"one of the dadaists accused art of being “a large-scale swindle.” the swindle was not financial, but ethical.",unknown
"“the dadaist considers it necessary to come out against art, because he has seen through its fraud as a moral safety valve.” accordingly, “dada is forever the enemy of that comfortable sunday art which is supposed to uplift man by reminding him of agreeable moments.” this sounds severe, yet it’s demonstrably the case that dada won (“dada siegt” was a common rallying cry: dada triumphs), at least in the art world.",unknown
"in literature it seems different, until we remind ourselves that we don’t even need to make a special effort to stock our syllabuses with texts that caper and taunt, disoblige, harass, and generally refrain from “uplift.” after the harrowing misadventures chronicled in ralph ellison’s invisible man, the novel ends with the unsettling insinuation by its african american protagonist: “on the lower frequencies, i speak for you.” or consider virginia woolf’s wry observation in a room of one’s own: “women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size.” these statements are a constant reminder of the extravagant potentiality of literature.",unknown
"“i cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation of a true expression,” quipped henry david thoreau in walden, a book rife with semantic shenanigans.",unknown
"no wonder (one might be tempted to observe) people are wary of literature and art, both of which flamboyantly refuse to comply with heartfelt sentiments and good taste.",unknown
we are now deep into one of those periodically recurring features of american life in which there’s a seismic shift in focus by students and their families.,unknown
"in its aggregate form, this is known as a flight from the humanities.",unknown
"what this pattern reveals is that education (besides being, well, education) is a bet, a wager on the future.",unknown
"do you put your chips on the roulette wheel options of english, or engineering, studio art, animal husbandry, pharmacy?",unknown
these contested numbers reflect well on our department.,unknown
"it means we deliver the goods, as the saying has it.",unknown
but what are the goods?,unknown
"in the old-timey school formula—reading, writing, and ’rithmetic—we deliver two of the three.",unknown
but it’s not that simple.,unknown
"there’s also a lot of history that comes into play (after all, history is not exclusive to the history department any more than written english is exclusive to us).",unknown
"and there’s psychology, and sociology, and philosophy, and … but why enumerate, when the fact is that literature encompasses anything and everything?",unknown
one thing that literature definitely does not do is pander to your own views and biases.,unknown
"literature steers a wide berth around what’s been called “homophily,” described as “a tendency to listen to and associate with people like yourself, and to exclude outsiders.” this is from an article on the viral agency of social networks, “ war goes viral: how social media is being weaponized ” by emerson t. brooking and p. w. singer (in the november 2016 issue of the atlantic).",unknown
"i wouldn’t normally have listed grief counseling among the services we provide, but i’m not surprised that it has come to that.",unknown
"what this phenomenon reflects is the fact that in english classes students are being constantly exposed to the light and the dark of human endeavor, the sad and the happy, viciousness and beneficence, pluck and luck.",unknown
"there is no preordained response to the books we read, but there’s almost always a response, because stories and novels, poems and plays make a claim on us.",unknown
"collectively, it’s called literature not because it has “passed the test of time” but because it doesn’t claim attention as merchandise.",unknown
"we don’t read what we read because it’s popular (moby-dick was such a flop it effectively ended melville’s career as a writer, but many would now list it as their favorite book, including me).",unknown
"we read these things because they provide access to another world that is strangely like this world yet, like alice going into wonderland, once we’re inside we’re likely to find ourselves bemused, horrified, delighted, indifferent, but always learning.",unknown
the appetite for learning is what all the humanities provide.,unknown
"that can put a real damper on the learning process, which then feels like studying up for a driver’s license.",unknown
"the humanities give us something altogether different, and i’d put it this way: you can never pass the test.",unknown
"and that’s because there’s no test; there’s just life—and learning, with all its pleasures, irritants, and absorbing challenges.",unknown
i’ll end with a haunting provocation from robert frost.,unknown
but here’s where it gets interesting.,unknown
"“i’ve been thinking lately that politics is an extravagance,” he suggests, “an extravagance about grievances.",unknown
and poetry is an extravagance about grief.,unknown
"and grievances are something that can be remedied, and griefs are irremediable, you know.",unknown
"once again, spring has come — and gone already, having arrived as early as january.",unknown
"“that’s true,” i replied.",unknown
"of eighty-three classes, only eight had gender parity, while twenty-nine had a ratio of 10 to 1 (female to male).",unknown
retirements tell the story.,unknown
"this year we bade farewell to doug anderson, simon gatrell, and fred dolezal, who were preceded in retirement last year by hugh ruppersburg and charlie doyle.",unknown
"in fact, the only woman who has retired in the past eight years was the late judith ortiz cofer.",unknown
"and so it is fitting that the next department head will be michelle ballif, who will succeed me in august.",unknown
"but gender disparity in english means there’s disparity elsewhere, and this has the potential to replicate old stereotypes in worrisome ways.",unknown
"if the “hard” sciences and the “worldly” schools like business and engineering are predominately male, a tacit signal seeps out from the university, suggesting that some fields, like literary studies, have become a kind of “woman’s work.” such social maladjustments are reflected in the even more worrisome statistics about the profession.",unknown
these figures are alarming.,unknown
"fortunately, they are not replicated here at the university of georgia, but a single institution can’t hold out forever against national trends.",unknown
"as i’ve indicated in previous columns, these are hard times for the humanities, and we recently saw the president recommend complete defunding of the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities.",unknown
"fortunately, congress did not accept his recommendation, but the threat remains.",unknown
hard times is one thing; extinction is something else altogether.,unknown
"a classic of american history is richard hofstadter’s 1963 book anti-intellectualism in american life , with its bracing chronicle of everything you’d imagine from the title.",unknown
"but hofstadter was sensitive to the fact that the united states, as a democracy, has always needed to audition alternative voices, other perspectives; the intellectuals had no guaranteed stake in the outcome of public issues.",unknown
"but in times like these, we intellectuals occupy an increasingly precarious ground, recently made even more precarious in georgia by the governor’s signing into law the “campus carry” bill permitting concealed weapons on campus.",unknown
"as maureen downey’s “get schooled” blog for the atlanta constitution-journal reported earlier in may , an open records request revealed that the tally of calls against the bill in the 2017 legislative session was 14,873, while the number of those in favor was 145. no typo: the discrepancy is that extreme.",unknown
"it gives the phrase “special interests” a whole new profile, doesn’t it?",unknown
"we have legitimate interests as well, but apparently not special enough to count .",unknown
"we teach the whole complex world depicted in literary works, in which it’s clear that the skullduggery we face in the world today is nothing new.",unknown
"but it’s worth knowing there is historical precedent; it’s important to have access to other minds in other times, contending with the same traumas that seem so unprecedented today.",unknown
"but there’s a risk in the assessment as well, and i turn in conclusion to a warning ventured by the eminent scholar george steiner prefacing his book language and silence in 1970 (another moment of acute political trauma): “to think of literature, of education, of language, as if nothing very important had happened to challenge our very concept of these activities seems to me unrealistic,” he wrote with tactful restraint.",unknown
"“to read aeschylus or shakespeare—let alone to ‘teach’ them—as if the texts, as if the authority of the texts in our own lives, were immune from recent history, is subtle but corrosive illiteracy.”",unknown
"“i don’t know,” i had to admit.",unknown
what greek sophist is this statue representing?” i had no idea.,unknown
a long silence was my immediate response.,unknown
"as the proverbial deer in headlights, i could only stare back blankly, and then, finally, when the dead silence became too heavy, mumble, “i don’t know.” “demosthenes,” she announced to the class, and i registered her disappointment; i had been introduced to the class as a scholar of the sophists.",unknown
"yet in defense of my ignorance, i quickly told myself, had she given me a text , such as “on the crown,” i might have had a fighting chance to respond differently.",unknown
"that is, i don’t exactly plaster my office walls with posters of the sophists.",unknown
"however, years later, i still feel a need to defend my ignorance.",unknown
yet isn’t “not knowing” precisely the reason for being a student?,unknown
"indeed, wasn’t that the reason that i chose to become an apprentice of classical art and architecture, so that i could learn what i didn’t know?",unknown
"as my primary discipline is rhetorical theory, i wanted to study in a second discipline—that of ancient art and aesthetics.",unknown
"my aim was to follow my desire to examine resonances between the principles of ancient rhetoric and ancient aesthetics, including principles of symmetry, perspective, proportion.",unknown
"so i found myself in the position of a student, humbled by my ignorance.",unknown
"we are, all of us, students.",unknown
you might say that being a student is our profession.,unknown
"we are students of language, of texts; it is our profession to engage with that which we don’t know.",unknown
"this research may, it is hoped, result in publications, but it most certainly results in enriched teaching.",unknown
"they need direction, they need to learn the tricks of using a complex system, and they need to know the protocol.",unknown
and of admitting it.,unknown
and of embracing it.,unknown
"indeed, i am suggesting that for all of us, being a student is to acknowledge the limits of our knowledge, to extend a gesture of hospitality toward the unknown, and to state without embarrassment, “i don’t know.” passionate learners make effective teachers.",unknown
he has accomplished this first through his passion for the subject-matter he teaches and his ability to transfer this passion to his students.,unknown
"his teaching style encourages students to wrestle with the most challenging questions of the texts, teaching us to ask these questions ourselves in our own readings.",unknown
we are also grateful for our other donors who provide support to our students.,unknown
"we hope their generosity inspires you, and we hope that you consider contributing to the english department’s threefold mission of teaching, research, and community research.",unknown

"additionally, we publicly thank dr. deborah miller for assuming the position of interim director of the first-year composition program, while we conduct a current national search.",unknown

"at the risk of revealing my peculiar threshold of entertainment, when i was in graduate school a hundred years ago, my cohort of students used to host a simulacrum of academic conferences, and assign ourselves papers to deliver, using theoretical frames to critique popular tv shows, such as: a feminist reading of bonanza ; a marxist reading of gilligan’s island ; a deconstructive reading of hawaii five-o.",unknown
"(clearly, i am dating myself; some who read this will also recognize when their references to popular culture receive blind stares.)",unknown
"but i have incorporated this scholarly play into my classroom, to encourage a sense of adventure, to underscore how interpretive strategies can be employed variously, in order to provide rich readings of texts.",unknown
"i call this exercise the “lit crit blowout.” at least, i smile.",unknown
"the point of this message is to highlight the intellect, curiosity, and ingenuity of our students.",unknown
"one of these “literary theory” students, astra taylor, went on to write several books, including examined life and an accompanying dvd of the same title, which interviews key theorists and asks them—as the title suggests—how concerns of justice, truth, and meaning, for example, inflect our readings.",unknown
"of our graduates this year, i have had the pleasure of learning from the interpretive work of students including keamber farley, alex williams, ellen everitt, lukas woodyard, rachel dier, mk manoylov, and julia koslowsky.",unknown

"santesso encourages her students to keep questioning, to join larger, interdisciplinary conversations, and to strive for excellence in and out of the classroom.” even as athens slows down to its summer pace, we'll be in park hall awaiting next year's students, who will bring with them their passion for learning, literature, and language.",unknown
welcome to 2020!,unknown
"and, although not an official anniversary, this new decade marks, roughly, the advent of the department of english at the university of georgia, approximately one hundred years ago.",unknown
"in a reaction to a national controversy over the value of teaching literature in the “mother tongue of our everyday life,” georgia’s board of trustees voted in the late 1800s that the teaching of english should be given more prominence, and so finally our community of scholars and students was given official sanction, as well as the institutional support to sustain us.",unknown

"their contributions to our department, to the university, and the greater profession have been many, and they will be sorely missed.",unknown
"additionally, i want to acknowledge all of our donors.",unknown
we express our deep appreciation to all our current—and—future donors.,unknown
both have served the department with dedication during the past six years in their respective administrative positions of associate head and undergraduate coordinator.,unknown
"the work done in such administrative positions, along with the work of their support staff, is often invisible, but is essential to ensuring the conditions of possibility for our individual and collective success.",unknown
"as part of our core mission statement, the department of english is proud to offer students “a sympathetic participation in the verbal worlds of other times and places, drawing on the full range of linguistic tools, historic knowledge, and interpretive experience at our disposal.” aiming to “allow our students to enhance their appreciation of expressive possibility,” we hope to develop “a sophisticated, practical grasp of the central role that language plays in the preservation of human institutions”—and relations, i would add.",unknown
"these theories also invite ethical implications for how one chooses to “be in the world.” we each make many choices every day, but choices always have consequences.",unknown
"one of the theorists we read, martha nussbaum, for example, discussed the importance of mutual care as a foundation for justice.",unknown
"to me, this idea highlights the lived experience that we are each brought into this world, absolutely dependent on the care of others.",unknown
"as a corollary, subsequently, we have the responsibility for others, as well.",unknown
"as many of you don’t know, i live on a farm, and i well know the responsibilities of caring for, nurturing, and sustaining all under my care.",unknown
"this “response-ability,” as scholar diane davis notes, means we have an ethical obligation to respond to the other, insofar as we are able.",unknown
"we respond when anyone calls us—not necessarily in a moment of distress, but when someone says our name or when a stranger hails us.",unknown
"that is: when called, even metaphorically, i turn; i respond , as responsibly as i am able, because i acknowledge that there are many who have nurtured me and provided opportunity for me.",unknown
this response becomes the answer to the call to be responsible to these others.,unknown
"all best, michelle ballif",unknown

"by studying medieval texts and how language functions within them, she hopes to open new windows for analyzing the past.",unknown
"in one example of her research, dr. mattison discusses an old, popular arthurian legend.",unknown
"it was spread through england, but instead of being written in old english, it was written in french.",unknown
"it is this type of syncretism of languages, literatures, and cultures that is so fascinating to dr. mattison.",unknown
"however, this intersection is under-researched, as people from both sides of study - english and french - are unsure where, exactly, the literature falls under.",unknown
"luckily, dr. mattison cares little for categories, and far more about the important conclusions that might be drawn from a more interdisciplinary study of these types of literature and language.",unknown
the physical study of manuscripts is also a passion of dr. mattison’s.,unknown
"between old, decaying pages, many treasures can be found.",unknown
"for example, a flower, pressed between lines of latin, aged and forgotten.",unknown
"“it’s interesting to think about how something that for them was an everyday object has become such a valuable source to us,” she says.",unknown
"there are less romantic things, like dirt, or even book curses -- violent poems directing misfortune and injury at book thieves.",unknown
what wonderful continuity; hundreds of years ago people treasured their books just as much as they do today.,unknown
dr. mattison is just as cool outside of her office as she is in it.,unknown
"first off, she was wearing a sweater that she had knitted herself when i interviewed her -- you can’t get cooler than that.",unknown
"she also enjoys cooking, and doesn’t limit herself to one culture either.",unknown
"in contrast to the serenity dr. mattison says cooking brings her, she seeks the adrenaline provided by top-roping, a style of rock climbing.",unknown
"“it’s very stress relieving,” she says sarcastically, “to be twenty, thirty feet off the ground.” to relax from that harrowing experience, dr. mattison enjoys watching bad reality tv, reading all of jane austen (especially emma ), and listening to boygenius.",unknown
"to wrap up the interview, i ask dr. mattison a question i’ve been thinking about: if she could show something created by humanity to an alien society, what would it be?",unknown
"she takes a moment to think, then says, “notre dame.” beyond its architectural and historical significance, the building itself is representative of 19th century medievalism, which has its roots in “colonialism, nostalgia, and nationalism.” these issues bleed into the value placed today on “white, western, christian art” over non-western art, as seen with reactions to the 2019 fire at notre dame versus the lack of sympathy for other losses of cultural heritage.",unknown
"“for me, notre dame is as much an idea of the past as part of the actual past.” to show aliens notre dame is to show them the refracted rainbow of humanity: the dreams, the losses, and the bones the present is built upon.",unknown
"instead, the english department sought him for the position.",unknown
"at the time, he was teaching at louisiana state university, where his work focused on african american literature and multi-ethnic southern literature.",unknown
"his love for football also influenced his decision, and he is proud to have witnessed two championship wins during his time at uga, confessing that “[he] loves the dawgs and the traditions of the game.” originally from atlanta, dr. lowe received his b.a.",unknown
"instead, he went to law school at emory university, but he was only able to complete one year of the program before being drafted into the army.",unknown
"after serving in the army, he worked as a financial analyst at donne and bradstreet in atlanta, but he quickly became “restless” there.",unknown
"his wife persuaded him to attend graduate school under the gi bill, and he attended georgia state “because [he] couldn’t afford emory” at the time.",unknown
"initially, his dissertation focused on “faulkner, melville, and the bible,” but when traveling to spain with his wife, “all [his] melville books were stolen with [their] luggage.” because he needed to finish his dissertation to begin his post at st. mary’s college in notre dame, he “dropped melville, and [st. mary’s] never knew that.” he taught at st. mary’s for four years before receiving a mellon appointment at harvard in african american studies.",unknown
he decided to re-enter the job market now that his recommendation letters were all written on harvard stationary.,unknown
"out of over fourteen interviews, he accepted a position at lsu, and “[he] never thought [he’d] leave” until uga “came calling.” while he “knew there was a job” in southern literature open at uga, he “wasn’t interested,” but that quickly changed.",unknown
"he has now been teaching southern literature at the university of georgia since 2012. although he was initially “torn” between lsu and uga, he says, “[coming to uga] was a good decision, and i’ve been happy here.",unknown
"although he is known for his work in southern literature, he has cast his net much more widely, working in multi-ethnic southern literature that includes african american, native american, italian american, asian american, and caribbean literature.",unknown
"as he remarked, when it comes to southern literature, “you name it,” and he’s done it.",unknown
he sets apart a few defining moments within his career.,unknown
"at lsu, he directed their summer program in italy for six years, and even now, his office is decorated with photographs of the classes he took to italy.",unknown
he received a fulbright in munich and was one of the founders of african american studies at lsu.,unknown
he is “proudest” of the conference he organized for melus (multi-ethnic literature of the united states) in 2015 at uga.,unknown
"his newest book, black hibiscus: african americans and the florida imaginary , will be published soon, and he is currently editing a book on colson whitehead.",unknown
"with numerous book projects still in the works, dr. lowe “is still busy” as his retirement approaches, and he plans to keep it that way.",unknown
"realizing that he is “really an office person” and “can’t work at home,” his first goal in retirement is “try to develop the ability to work at home,” but his main priority is to “keep doing [his] books and…going to conferences.” his retirement will not be all work, however.",unknown
"he wants to start working out with his wife through silver sneakers, play racquet ball with a longtime friend from louisiana, and play the piano more “seriously.” he is a “serious cook” and plans on hosting more dinner parties while learning spanish through lacsi (latin american caribbean studies institute).",unknown
he is travelling to france in september for a southern literature conference.,unknown
"out of his retirement plans, he is “most looking forward to finishing [the] biography [of ernest gaines]”: “it’s really a burden for me…it’s the first one, and he asked me to write it.",unknown
i have a solemn promise to him.,unknown
he died in 2019…i’m writing it for him.,unknown
i’m not writing it for me.,unknown
"i want his reputation to be larger than it is now and have more people reading him.” as dr. lowe prepares for retirement, he looks back on his career while looking forward to the legacies that he wants to leave.",unknown
"he hopes that his teaching has left students not only with the “skills to better understand the value of literature,” but also the skills “to make them better citizens.” he believes that “literature often gives you guideposts for life,” which helps students become better (literary) citizens in the world through what they read.",unknown
"he is “proud of [his] legacy with graduate students,” having directed twenty-nine dissertations throughout his career.",unknown
"for him, his biggest legacy lies in his work with african american ph.d. students at lsu.",unknown
"he keeps pictures of those students in his office, noting that “they’ve all gone on to be great teachers and administrators all over the country.” he sees those students as “carrying on the work [he’s] done.",unknown
he is confident that his relationship with those friendships “will continue.” he and his wife have no intentions of leaving athens anytime soon.,unknown
"rather, he reassures us, “we’ll be here.” brianna phillips is an english ph.d. student and fyw instructor in the english department at uga.",unknown

"“and for him, that was the high part of the summer as far as i’m concerned.” dr. freer died of lewy body dementia in 2019. his wife ramona freer, and their daughters meg and elinor, wanted to establish a scholarship in his honor and keep his beloved memory alive.",unknown
"“they didn’t want to call mom and dad and ask for money,” said mrs. freer.",unknown
"“they insisted on doing it on their own, but it was hard [...] so i know what they’re [graduate students are] going through.” “it’d be nice to be able to help somebody, somebody who really needed the help,” continued mrs. freer.",unknown

"they held an election, selecting a president, vice-president, and other essential board members, and made a list of goals for the semester.",unknown

dr. joshua king has been playing and writing with video games since his doctoral days at the university of georgia.,unknown
"for him, game design is about choice and creating experiences for the player in the same way that texts implement specific rhetorical choices to shape a certain experience for the reader.",unknown
"when “you’re reading, you’re having the experience based on the words someone else wrote,” an experience “designed” by the writer.",unknown
"“games do the same thing” because “when you’re playing a game, you’re having fun or you’re being frustrated or you’re competing with people because of rules that someone else made.” while “a read experience is kind of quiet.",unknown
"it’s so internalized, and reading is so familiar that we really don’t think about it,” “playing a game is a loud experience” that demonstrates how choice “create[s] experiences” that “move us.” even as he strives to revitalize rhetoric for students through video games, he notes that in many respects, his game-based writing classroom is still “a traditional writing and rhetoric class,” though you will see students playing games such as the stanley parable and what remains of edith finch .",unknown
"students learn about the writing process, rhetorical devices, and academic research as they discuss texts such as richard lamb’s economies of attention and shira chess’s ready player two.",unknown
what “sets this [class] apart from all other ones” is his decision to give students the whole semester to design their games instead of only 4-6 weeks.,unknown
"with only a month to work on their projects, students felt that their projects “were over before they really got to dig in.” in fall 2022, dr. king also tried out “studio mondays,” which were designated workdays that alternated between guided workshops, “guided play tests” between students, and individual, self-guided work time.",unknown
"he was prepared to “stop doing studio mondays if it stops being productive,” but “it never did.” every monday, students were “doing amazing, impressive things.",unknown
"the most constructive move that writing instructors can make, dr. king suggests, is “defamiliarizing” the familiar for students.",unknown
"he “defamiliarizes rhetoric” through game-playing, urging students to question what it means to play a game and read a text or to design a game and write a text.",unknown
"there is value, he contends, in teaching writing “unconventionally” and “approaching it from [a] different angle” because an unfamiliar approach “takes this thing that we think is really normal and boring, like writing and reading and…dramatizes the fact that it’s not normal or boring at all.",unknown
"in that way, defamiliarizing rhetoric simultaneously foregrounds how familiar rhetoric is by emphasizing how much our daily lives are “surrounded” by it.",unknown
"as students realize how “language moves us,” the fact that language moves the world and that we “move” language daily becomes tangibly, powerfully ordinary.",unknown
"for dr. king, the first year writing classroom is a space in which the normal becomes as defamiliarized as it is familiarized.",unknown
only then can we “keep limber” our experiences of language.,unknown

she continued to teach austen and 18th and 19th century british literature.,unknown
"twenty-nine years later, she’s held positions in administration: two terms as the undergraduate coordinator, one as social media coordinator, and most recently she was associate head for two years.",unknown
"no matter what position she held, though, dr. eberle always maintained her passion for teaching.",unknown
she says that one of the things she’ll miss most is the moments of unique insight and discovery that can only be found in the classroom.,unknown
"“there are just moments of pure joy,” she says.",unknown
"moments where she introduces a student to a novel or poem, and they have an insight that “blows my mind.” there are funny moments too; for example, when a student titled an essay “samuel taylor coleridge, the drug addict” after she had mentioned his addiction to laudanum in passing.",unknown
"dr. eberle felt it was an important lesson for her future teaching philosophies, which are largely informed by making sure students have proper context and biography, so that they can better engage with and understand the work.",unknown
"later in her career, dr. eberle feels fortunate to have been able to mentor a host of wonderful graduate students.",unknown
"“watching them grow and flourish has been really important—truly priceless,” she says.",unknown
paralleling her love of teaching is dr. eberle’s love of books.,unknown
"“i got my first purse when i was eight, and i got it solely for the purpose of keeping books in there,” she says, laughing.",unknown
"“i was chewing gum and reading a magazine, and i got a call from ucla offering me a fellowship.” at ucla, her dissertation shifted from virginia woolf to a passion that has endured for her: lesser-known women writers of the romantic era.",unknown
"while she loved—and still loves—virginia woolf and the well-known writers of that period, she “[loves] the detective work of learning about these women writers, who had been so well-known in their period, but completely forgotten with time.” after 29 years at uga, though, dr. eberle is looking forward to the future.",unknown
"“i’ve loved every minute, but i’m also pretty excited about the next stage,” she says.",unknown
"in california, where dr. eberle plans to move with her husband, waits a sizable family, and her daughter, who is finishing her last year at berkeley.",unknown
"the project she is most anticipating is finishing her second book, amelia opie’s sociable lives , and reading all of virginia woolf’s writing— “from the very beginning to the very end in chronological order, inclusive of novels, letters, and diaries.” she says she feels it’s fitting to her “narrative arc” because her journey in academia began with virginia woolf, so it provides a satisfying symmetry to wrap it up the same way.",unknown
"most important to dr. eberle, though, is to never stop growing.",unknown

"his last name is pronounced like the word “vague,” plus “shuh,” but he prefers roland.",unknown
"roland was born to an intellectually driven family mostly composed of mathematicians and engineers in nyíregyháza, hungary in the midst of the cold war.",unknown
"although his family encouraged him to follow in their footsteps, roland found that literature provided a way to imagine life outside of the historical circumstances he grew up in.",unknown
"roland entered university right after the cold war, when hungarian academia was trying to reignite its intellectual traditions, and what he called a “transitional decade.” “people were really all over the country, looking for new ideas, and trying to imagine a completely new future that was unimaginable to that point,” said roland.",unknown
"“so it was very exciting to be at the university at that time.” during his time at the university of debrecen, roland became interested in the hungarian literary philosopher, györgy lukács, whose work was largely forgotten in the 90s.",unknown
"roland’s work led him to a university in germany, but hungary was not part of the eu at the time, making logistics difficult.",unknown
"one of his advisors suggested he apply to american universities where he would have more opportunities, and he accepted an offer from state university of new york at buffalo.",unknown
"his first job was at the university of tennessee, knoxville, and then he worked for the university of nebraska-lincoln for 9 years before arriving at uga.",unknown
"outside of his job, roland spends most of his time with his children, but he also enjoys music, yoga, and walking.",unknown

clare is exceedingly passionate about pedagogy and professional development.,unknown
"with her color-coded spreadsheets, binders, and journals, she stays on top of everything in her role as a “catch-all” for first-year writing.",unknown
"she enjoys reading the variety of syllabi within english 1101 and 1102, especially the unique topics, such as horror, walt whitman, and even the percy jackson series.",unknown
"her work focuses on medieval art made by these women as it relates to “embodied cognition”—the process of flowed thinking, when the body is doing a physical task but the mind operates in a flowing state of thought.",unknown
"“the nuns used work and specifically artistic creation as a form of mediation and prayer,” she says.",unknown
"“and they were aware of this concept of flow…and why they were doing their art.” her passion derives from the fact that this undiscussed history rebukes much of the common perceptions about middle-age women, which often characterize them as isolated and having little intelligent thought, much less artistic ability.",unknown
"because of this interest, clare focused on the art and lives of these medieval women for her master’s capstone project, which you can find here .",unknown
"it’s a very impressive multi-media project that showcases six activities based on what she describes as “multi-century, multi-modal ways to experience the art medieval nuns were doing.” you can even recreate some of the nuns’ art!",unknown
"beyond park hall, clare says she reads “a shocking number of books”—90 last year and 28 so far this year (probably much higher now, as this article was published weeks after the interview).",unknown
"she likes to be in touch with her artistic side; she knits, cooks, sews, paints, and keeps a bullet journal, which i’m sure is very detailed.",unknown
her favorite thing to bake is bread; she described in detail how she bakes three loaves a week for herself and her fiance!,unknown
"she is also a veteran of nanowrimo, having spent a decade completing the challenge annually.",unknown
"but she’s a bit worried about completing it this year: “i’m getting married this year, and i’m having my wedding in the middle of november—am i going to get it done?” she laughs.",unknown
"“we’ll see.” she enjoys the projects that come out of the race against the clock that is nanowrimo, whether they be good or just ridiculous fun.",unknown
"to our interview, i asked clare who her favorite poets are.",unknown
"she has great taste; she recited sappho, mary oliver, and billy collins in the span of minutes.",unknown
"a poem of mary oliver’s, whom she described as one of her favorite poets from childhood, has turned in my head for hours.",unknown
"it is what mary oliver said at her partner’s funeral: “ when we pray to love god perfectly, / surely we do not mean only.",unknown
"/ (lord, see how well i have done.",unknown
").” just one floor up from clare, i found peyton mitchell in her office.",unknown
peyton mitchell is the office assistant for park hall and the assistant for uga’s creative writing program.,unknown
she graduated from uga quite recently—in fall 2022—with a bachelor of fine arts in drawing and painting.,unknown
"because she didn’t want to leave athens just yet, she found a place within park hall as the office assistant, which handles mail distribution, student questions, and general office management.",unknown
mitchell’s natural creativity drew her to art from a young age.,unknown
"“my mom has a painting hanging in my childhood home that i did when i was three,” she says, smiling fondly.",unknown
"though she dabbled in interdisciplinary modes of art, such as 2-d and 3-d, her heart always gravitates towards drawing and painting.",unknown
"the first step she took to becoming professionally trained was not at uga, but georgia southern, where she spent two years.",unknown
"as she was nearing the end of her second year, she felt she and her husband—who was also going to school there—needed a change, so they moved to athens around the same time the pandemic began.",unknown
"it was at uga that mitchell created “lost in intimate reverie,” her exit show for the lamar dodd school of art.",unknown
"her work is influenced by the impressionist movement because of how the artists redefined the use of light in painting, and especially monet.",unknown
"“i love that towards the end of his life, monet was defining things a lot less…it became about color,” she says.",unknown
she wanted to incorporate undefined style and use of light into her own work.,unknown
“my paintings are of flowers and landscapes but what i’m really engaging with is color.” i don’t really think ‘engaging’ quite captures what mitchell does with color; she embodies it in her art.,unknown
"the hues—neon orange, fuschia, deep blues and violets—explode from the canvas and ignite a spark in the mind.",unknown
beneath the vibrancy of her art lies a determination: “my goal in painting is not to focus on personal traumas…i don’t owe you my hardship.,unknown
"i want to create light and a space for people to get lost in that.” to get lost in the light, take a look at mitchell’s work here .",unknown
"beyond work, mitchell and her husband can be seen within molly’s and thousand faces coffee on the weekends.",unknown
"in her free time, mitchell enjoys crochet (her first project was a jacket) and reading, especially poetry and novels.",unknown
"fantasy is her favorite genre, which she links to the escapism intrinsic to her identity as a painter.",unknown
"her favorite poet is mary oliver; she decorated her graduation cap with the final two lines from mary oliver’s poem “the summer day”: “tell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?” mitchell seems to be doing very well with hers.",unknown

o’brien’s 1938 novel pray for the wanderer is part of a collection of irish novels published in the late 1930s which exhibit a late modernist concern with the relationship between art and its political context(s).,unknown
"like beckett’s murphy (1938) and flann o’brien’s at swim-two-birds (1939), the novel’s central character is an irish man and artist who is alienated from an ireland in which “the family is the fundamental unit group of society” (the constitution of ireland 1937, article 41.1.2).",unknown
"pray for the wanderer grapples uneasily with the transition from the irish free state to éire and the dawning of a political frontier in which catholic values are not only predominant, but are firmly manifest in the constitution.",unknown
"although the novel has been read primarily as an eloquent response to censorship, the irish constitution of 1937 is the focal point for o’brien’s concerns about the erosion of individual liberty.",unknown
"written concurrently with the drafting of the constitution, the novel probes the ideologies of familism and pro-natalism in their legislative and social forms, exploring their impact on art, citizenship and personal autonomy at a political turning point in post-independence ireland.",unknown

"fullerton’s recreation of thoreau’s concord and walden pond is more classical, virtual and even cinematic, a paradoxically technological transcendentalism of play focused on the observing subject.",unknown
"conversely, reihana’s more explicitly panoramic work about the cook expeditions, which emerges from ‘polynesian’ auckland, suggests in its layers and reenactments a more distributed and indeed augmented agency in the pacific when compared with the ‘atlantic world.’ why walden pond might appear more virtual and a pacific island more augmented can be better understood by returning to the archives of two print-age pacific expeditions by james cook and george macartney.",unknown
"both men ostensibly failed in their imperial tasks, and yet the printed journals and engravings of the expeditions, including the french wallpaper that reihana draws upon, became fundamental to new conceptions of nature and empire in the late eighteenth century.",unknown
such media objects indicate the use of a more consciously panoramic approach to counter anxiety over erratic failures of mastery and masculinity in a revolutionary age.,unknown

book description from the oxford up website: crafting feminism develops a dynamic study of craft and art-making in modern and contemporary feminist writing.,unknown
"in evocative readings of literary works from virginia woolf to zadie smith, this book expands our sense of transartistic modernist scholarship to encompass process-oriented and medium-specific analyses of textile arts, digital design, collage, photography, painting, and sculpture in literary culture.",unknown
"by integrating these craft practices into the book's enlightening archive, elkins's theoretical argument extends a reading of craft metaphors into the material present.",unknown
"crafting feminism demonstrates how writers have engaged with handiwork across generations and have undertaken the crafting of a new modernity, one that is queer and feminist-threaded, messy, shattered, cut-up, pasted together, preserved, repaired, reflected, and spun out.",unknown
"an avant-garde work of scholarship, this book interweaves queer research methods and interdisciplinary rigor with a series of surprising archival discoveries.",unknown
"making visible the collaborative, creative features of craft, elkins captivates readers with generous illustrations and a series of ""techne"" interchapters-interludes between longer chapters, which powerfully convey the symbiosis between feminist theory and method, and detail the network of archival influences that underpin this volume's hybrid approach.",unknown

"additionally, students can pursue the study of writing within the emerging field of electronic textuality and its relation to other areas of study, such as humanities computing and literary theory.",unknown
students who select rhetoric and composition as one of their areas of specialization do so with varying purposes: some students seek to supplement their traditional literary studies with principles of rhetorical analyses; others wish to prepare themselves more fully to teach writing at the secondary or college level; and still others aim to pursue an academic career in rhetoric and composition.,unknown

"although often stereotyped as the “nation’s other,” the south has participated in every military conflict since the civil war, and like the nation, has been transformed by the rise of cities, multinational corporations, and webbed systems of transportation and communication.",unknown
"increasingly, it has interacted - as it always has - with the circumcaribbean, through trade, political ruptures and treaties, cultural exchanges, and mutual cultural influences, particularly music, art, and dance.",unknown
"as a crucial component of southern culture, southern literature has mapped histories of native americans, diasporic africans, colonization, slavery, immigration, agriculture, industrialization, and increasingly, urbanization.",unknown
"while the study of southern cultures once was concentrated in literature and history, it has expanded to include food studies, climate studies, race and gender studies, ethnic studies (especially african american and native studies), queer studies, and popular culture, which includes film, television, graphic works, music, and digital media.",unknown
"these developments have been absorbed by the “new southern studies,” which has generated many new approaches to the u.s. south and its larger configurations with the circumcaribbean, the hemisphere, and the atlantic world.",unknown
"critics such as richard gray, patricia yaeger, martyn bone, harriet pollack, thadious davis, jose limón, trudier harris, keith cartwright, anna brickhouse, gary richards and susan donaldson have put a new slant on the field of southern literature.",unknown
"also, the configuration of the u.s. south with the caribbean has brought in theoretical perspectives from figures such as édouard glissant, j. michael dash, valérie loichot, deborah cohn, and vincent pérez.",unknown
"historians such as david blight, marcus rediker, rebecca j. scott, matthew guterl, nell painter, michael trouillot, daniel heath justice, chadwick allen, and rod ferguson and others have reshaped our concepts of southern and circumcaribbean history.",unknown

they represent your most “finished” pieces of writing.,unknown
one revision exhibit that demonstrates your composing process and revision skills.,unknown
"for this exhibit, students typically present a portion of a paper (e.g., a paragraph or the thesis statement); and demonstrate the development of this piece of writing through several drafts.",unknown

abstract: modern content management systems make it easy to build web-based repositories or digital libraries.,unknown
"such systems often allow the user to create new content types consisting of any number of named fields; the fields might contain simple values (attributes), references to other content type instances (relationships), or references to files.",unknown
"even when using the same content management system, repositories can differ in structure: some repositories may have a single content type (e.g.,resource) with associated metadata fields (e.g., dublin core metadata fields).",unknown
"other repositories may define multiple content types, connected by relationships.",unknown
"our approach begins with the definition of small schema fragments that we call domain structures, where the domain structure describes (just) what is needed to support a widget of interest.",unknown
"for example, in order to support a hierarchical navigation widget, we use a domain structure with one entity (resource) with a single attribute (title), with a recursive relationship (part-of) that relates resources.",unknown
"given a domain structure, we ask domain-savvy end-users to define simple correspondences from the components of the domain structure to their local structure.",unknown
"in effective, we seek to support end-user schema mapping.",unknown
"we have implemented these ideas in the drupal content management system; we host several educational repositories with generic widgets that support navigation, (selective) cloning and downloading.",unknown

the project has shown progress in a type of task known as “pick-inspect-place.” robots in agriculture or manufacturing have long been involved in picking and placing tasks.,unknown
"here, researchers have added the element of inspecting using computer vision, as well.",unknown
"“there are basically two ai models,” said prasanth suresh, a doctoral student on the project.",unknown
“there’s one that teaches the robot the behavior and one that detects the object using vision.,unknown
"the second ai model will detect the object and instruct the proper behavior—r inspection for blemishes on good onions or throwing blemished onions in the waste.” the idea, doshi said, is not to eliminate these professions for human workers, but to provide options, protect the job from labor shortages and to upskill workers into positions that require less strenuous conditions.",unknown
"“often, these workers work through high heat, dust, or other conditions,” he said.",unknown
“we are not trying to replace this worker.,unknown
… ai has suffered from a little bit of a perception issue.,unknown
