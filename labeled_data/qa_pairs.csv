['What is the name of modern content management systems?'],abstract: modern content management systems make it easy to build web-based repositories or digital libraries.
['What is the name of the fields that are used to create content types?'],"such systems often allow the user to create new content types consisting of any number of named fields; the fields might contain simple values (attributes), references to other content type instances (relationships), or references to files."
['What is the name of the two main metadata fields that repositories may have?'],"even when using the same content management system, repositories can differ in structure: some repositories may have a single content type (e.g.,resource) with associated metadata fields (e.g., dublin core metadata fields)."
['What are the multiple content types defined by other repositories?'],"other repositories may define multiple content types, connected by relationships."
['What is the pedagogical approach used by the instructor?'],we focus here on educational repositories where courses have a rich structure and where each course may have a different structure – based on the pedagogical approach used by the instructor.
['What are the widgets that work for all courses?'],"we seek to make it easy to develop generic widgets that will work for all courses, for example."
['What is the domain structure called?'],"our approach begins with the definition of small schema fragments that we call domain structures, where the domain structure describes (just) what is needed to support a widget of interest."
['What is the recursive relationship between resources and resources?'],"for example, in order to support a hierarchical navigation widget, we use a domain structure with one entity (resource) with a single attribute (title), with a recursive relationship (part-of) that relates resources."
['What do end-users ask to define?'],"given a domain structure, we ask domain-savvy end-users to define simple correspondences from the components of the domain structure to their local structure."
['What is the part of relationship between the domain structure and the local units-in-course relationship'],"for example, a user might map resource (in the domain structure) to the local course content type, map resource, again, to the local unit content type, and the part-of relationship (in the domain structure) to the local units-in-course relationship."
['What is the goal of the end-user schema mapping?'],"in effective, we seek to support end-user schema mapping."
"[""What widget is a user's course displayed in?""]","once mapped, a user’s course appears in a full-featured navigation widget."
['What is the name of the system that hosts educational repositories?'],"we have implemented these ideas in the drupal content management system; we host several educational repositories with generic widgets that support navigation, (selective) cloning and downloading."
['What is the prototype mapping interface?'],the talk will demonstrate the features of our repositories including the widgets and a prototype mapping interface.

['What is the name of the novel wuthering heights?'],"the question of how (or why, or whether) to commingle queer theory and ecocriticism has become an urgent concern for many theorists writing in the wake of timothy morton’s 2010 pmla essay “queer ecology.” while greg garrard, for example, thinks that queer theory needs ecocriticism in order to avoid theoretical bankruptcy and irrelevance, jordy rosenberg argues exactly the opposite, warning that certain versions of eco-theory are guilty of promulgating “a primitivist fantasy that hinges on the violent erasure of the social: the conjuring of a realm—an ‘ancestral realm’—that exists in the present, but in parallax to historical time.” this talk will develop rosenberg's analysis by taking up the question of eco-queer futurity in three emblematic victorian texts: emily bronte’s 1847 novel wuthering heights , matthew arnold’s 1867 poem “dover beach,” and gerard manley hopkins’s “binsey poplars” (1879)."
