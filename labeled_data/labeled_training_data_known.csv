dr. joshua king has been playing and writing with video games since his doctoral days at the university of georgia.,ask_graduate_program
"in the first year writing department, dr. king is known for his game-based writing courses that rely on video games and game design to “defamiliarize” students’ understandings of rhetorical choices and the “experiences” that texts offer.",ask_academic_program
"his initial interest in pairing writing/rhetoric with gaming began in a graduate course taught dr. iyengar in 2012. in that course, he designed a video game based on edmund spenser’s the faerie queen (1590), a project that radically changed how he experienced spenser’s text.",ask_academic_program
his faerie queen game inspired him to continue “thinking about the cross-over between games and literature” and “the process of creating something that someone else gets to play” throughout his phd program.,ask_graduate_program
"since that initial encounter with writing and gaming, he has taught multiple iterations of his game-based writing course, both at the 3000- and 1000-level, at various institutions, including at the university of georgia and georgia tech.",ask_academic_program
"when “pitching” the course to students, dr. king emphasizes the experiential nature of reading/writing a text and playing games.",ask_academic_program
"dr. king designs the course so that the “[video] games are happening alongside more traditional academic texts,” and students begin to see how both texts and video games construct meaning and “work as rhetoric.” he uses the stanley parable to “talk about how choice works” in game design and writing.",announce_lecture
"when students play what remains of edith finch, a “more narrative” and “story-based game,” they discuss how the game “create[s] meaning” and “work[s]…as storytelling.” throughout the course, dr. king emphasizes to students that “when they’re writing something, they’re still creating an experience” as they “think about an audience,” “structure something,” and “make rhetorical devices in…writing.” as students design their own games for the final project, they create these “experiences” through a platform that makes rhetorical choices “really noticeable,” a process that is often too “subtle” for students when their exposure to rhetoric is limited to traditional texts.",ask_academic_program
"dr. king “sets apart” his most recent version of the course, a 3000-level class taught in fall 2022, as the most “impressive” one because of a small change to the final project.",ask_academic_program
"with only a month to work on their projects, students felt that their projects “were over before they really got to dig in.” in fall 2022, dr. king also tried out “studio mondays,” which were designated workdays that alternated between guided workshops, “guided play tests” between students, and individual, self-guided work time.",announce_event
"they had real questions, they had work lists, they divided things and used monday…to assign themselves work for the rest of the week.” seeing students actively guide themselves through their projects was one of the most rewarding aspects of the course for dr. king.",ask_academic_program
"that it’s really sophisticated and complex.” instructors should “[find] new ways of talking about [writing and rhetoric]” because it “keeps us limber and keeps us more aware of how texts we’re surrounded by work.” students “think about rhetoric a little differently, maybe even a little bit more broadly after taking a class with a weird focus.” defamiliarizing the first year writing classroom allows students to realize that rhetoric is built into everything we experience.",announce_lecture

"the question of how (or why, or whether) to commingle queer theory and ecocriticism has become an urgent concern for many theorists writing in the wake of timothy morton’s 2010 pmla essay “queer ecology.” while greg garrard, for example, thinks that queer theory needs ecocriticism in order to avoid theoretical bankruptcy and irrelevance, jordy rosenberg argues exactly the opposite, warning that certain versions of eco-theory are guilty of promulgating “a primitivist fantasy that hinges on the violent erasure of the social: the conjuring of a realm—an ‘ancestral realm’—that exists in the present, but in parallax to historical time.” this talk will develop rosenberg's analysis by taking up the question of eco-queer futurity in three emblematic victorian texts: emily bronte’s 1847 novel wuthering heights , matthew arnold’s 1867 poem “dover beach,” and gerard manley hopkins’s “binsey poplars” (1879).",announce_lecture
