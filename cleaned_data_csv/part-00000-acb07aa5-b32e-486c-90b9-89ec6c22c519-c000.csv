"https://www.cs.uga.edu/faq/content/graduate-school-faqs","graduate school faqs what is the deadline for submitting my application for fall or spring semester? the graduate school has posted deadlines for submission of fall and spring applications on their website at http://grad.uga.edu/index.php/prospective-students /. the school of computing considers applications on a continuous basis for fall and spring semesters. applications that do not meet the deadline for the upcoming semester are considered for the following semester. see school of computing website here for application deadlines: https://computing.uga.edu/graduate-admissions internatioanal applicants: fall admission- deadline is april 15th spring admission-deadline is october 15th domestic applicants: fall admission-deadline is july 1st spring admission-deadline is november 15th i am thinking of applying to the school of computing but before i do, i would like to know if i would be eligible for admission with financial aid? the department follows a two-phase process for admission to the graduate degree program (ms, mams or phd) and award of financial aid. first, the applicants are considered for admission to the graduate degree program. second, the applicants who are admitted are considered for financial aid. to know your eligibility for admission and/or financial aid, you will need to submit a formal application to one of the degree programs. the school of computing does not do an “informal” review or assessment of applications. what are my chances of getting admission and/or financial aid given my gre score? the gre score is only one of several criteria that the admission committee uses to evaluate applicants. the other criteria include: academic record (gpa); caliber and reputation of the applicant’s institution(s); applicant’s academic preparation (i.e., the courses taken in previous degree program(s)); toefl score (ibt) or ielts score; letters of recommendation. this includes the contents of the letters and the professional/academic standing of the authors of the letters; statement of purpose; publication record (if any); other factors which indicate that the applicant has special promise or potential. note that your chances of getting admission and/or financial aid also depend, to some extent, on the overall quality and size of the applicant pool (i.e., your competitors) at the time your application is under consideration. also note that the graduate school has stipulated some basic requirements for domestic and international applicants at http://grad.uga.edu/index.php/prospective-students/ . in addition, some international applicants must satisfy basic english language proficiency requirements as described in http://grad.uga.edu/index.php/prospective-students/international-application-information/international-supplement/english-language-proficiency-requirement/ can the gre requirement be waived in my case? the gre is waived for students applying to the phd computer science program. the gre is required f or students applying to any of the ms computer science programs. do my chances of getting financial aid depend on which degree program i apply for? should i apply for the phd program instead of the ms program in order to enhance my chances knowing that i cannot study in the us without financial aid? your chances of admission and award of financial aid depend primarily on your credentials, with accepted, qualified phd students as priority. we also consider department needs, enrollment, academic credentials, and english proficiency scores ( international students). ideally, when should i apply for financial aid? most financial aid awards are made in the fall semester. deadlines for nominating students for presidential graduate fellowships are typically in january whereas deadlines for graduate school assistantships are typically in february (the actual deadlines are on the graduate school website at http://grad.uga.edu/index.php/prospective-students/ . decisions regarding departmental assistantships are made starting typically in march for the following fall semester and in october for the following spring semester. it is to your advantage to have a complete application on file as early as possible if you are seeking financial assistance since it will improve your chances. to apply for school of computing ta and/or ra ships, see https://computing.uga.edu/graduate-financial-assistance. please check back on deadlines to apply. how do i apply for a departmental teaching assistant (ta) position? teaching assistantship application for qualified, accepted current and/or incoming students is found here: https://computing.uga.edu/graduate-financial-assistance. n ote that the center for teaching and learning, under the auspices of the vice president for instruction at the university of georgia, has stipulated certain criteria based on toefl ibt speak scores and ielts scores for eligibility for teaching assistant awards. please refer to http://www.ctl.uga.edu/pages/ta-policy for details. international applicants with toefl speak 23-25, ielts speak 7.0-7.5 duolingo 115-130, or ita tep level 3, qualify with english proficiency for limited duty teaching assistantship per ta policy. international applicants with toefl speak 26+, ielts speak 8.0+, duolingo 135+, ita tep level 4 qualify with english proficiency per ta policy. additional factors are considered in ta selection. how do i apply for a research assistant (ra) position? research assistant (ra) positions are funded typically by research grants or contracts awarded to individual faculty members. you may peruse the school of computing web page https://computing.uga.edu/ and the web pages of the individual faculty members to determine their research interests and current research projects. you are encouraged to contact the relevant faculty members to ascertain whether they have an open ra position and whether your credentials fit the requirements of the ra position. you are encouraged to apply on the school of computing website here: https://computing.uga.edu/graduate-financial-assistance. i have been admitted to your degree program but have not yet received the i-20. what should i do? please contact graduate admissions at gradadm@uga.edu in the graduate school to resolve the issue. also, kindly cc: cs-grad-coordinator@uga.edu in the school of computing on all correspondence with the graduate school. can i defer my application to the following semester? i have been admitted to your degree program for the upcoming semester but i have not yet received my visa to the usa. i am afraid that i may not be granted the visa in time to be at the university of georgia for the upcoming semester. the short answer is yes. but please get in touch with graduate admissions at gradadm@uga.edu in the graduate school to formally defer your application. you are permitted to defer once to a future term. also kindly email graduate coordinators at cs-grad-coordinator@uga.edu in the school of computing on all correspondence with the graduate school. you may defer only once, and the deferment must be made at least one week before classes begin in the initial accepted semester. please note, any employment as ta or ra with school of computing will be cancelled once the student has deferred. i have been admitted to your degree program but i have not yet arrived on the university of georgia campus. can you please advise me (via email or telephone) regarding the courses i should be taking? the short answer is no. to be formally advised, you need to be arrived on uga campus, complete the verification of lawful presence check in, and meet with the graduate coordinator in person or via zoom. email to cs-grad-coordinator@uga.edu to set up the appointment before or after you arrive. the annual expenses stated on the i-20 exceed the assistantship award. what do i need to do? for purposes of filling out i-20 forms and the like, the university of georgia could come up with a total estimate of costs which somehow exceeds the assistantship award by a few thousand dollars. the estimate is arbitrary, and often higher than it needs to be; however, it must be dealt with. in this situation, you have to prove that the funds to cover the shortfall are available from your personal assets. you will need to fill out a “ certification of finances ” form and provide a supporting bank statement. however, you will not actually need to spend these funds if you are at all careful with your discretionary choices of housing etc. in athens, ga. the monthly stipend in your assistantship award is sufficient for an unmarried (single) student to live on comfortably in athens, ga. for a complete itemized breakdown of tuition/fees for international students, contact your immigration advisor in office of global engagement. does the school of computing offer admission application fee waiver? the short answer is no. we do not provide application fee waivers. additionally we do not provide application fee waivers for any uga orientation programs. how do i defer my application to a future term? students who have applied to school of computing are permitted to defer once, to a future term. email to uga graduate admissions at gradadm@uga.edu with your full name, degree sought, and term to defer at least one week before or more before class start. graduate degree programs graduate student forms graduate student handbook graduate advising graduate admissions phd exams graduate student resources graduate student travel graduate financial assistance frequently asked questions graduate student association support us we appreciate your financial support. your gift is important to us and helps support critical opportunities for students and faculty alike, including lectures, travel support, and any number of educational events that augment the classroom experience. click here to learn more about giving . every dollar given has a direct impact upon our students and faculty."
