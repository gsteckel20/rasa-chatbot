the second way is to demonstrate proficiency (a higher level of language fluency) in one foreign language; the third way is to demonstrate reading knowledge of one foreign language and competence in specified research skills. the student's advisory committee must approve the language or languages offered, and the graduate committee must approve any proposed set of research skills (such a plan of study should involve substantial study taken at the graduate level outside the english department). new graduate students should plan to satisfy this portion of their degree requirements as soon after matriculation as possible. comprehensive examinations. no later than the end of the third year, the student will complete his or her written and oral comprehensive examinations. these examinations are administered by a three-member examining committee (the student's advisory committee) appointed by the graduate coordinator in consultation with the student's major professor. the examinations cover three areas chosen from the approved areas listed in the graduate student handbook by the student and approved by the student's advisory committee. a reading list is composed for each area of examination in consultation with the examining faculty member of the advisory committee. the written portion of each of the three exams is typically a field survey or literature review of approximately 20 pages (excluding bibliography) of each examination area, as directed by the examining faculty member of the advisory committee. an oral portion of the exam provides time to follow up on the written component, as well as to discuss the items on the reading list. in addition, all students prepare a \"project description,\" which is a preliminary discussion on the students' dissertation topic. this is an 8-10 page document, with an accompanying annotated bibliography. the project description defines a research question that is worth pursuing and demonstrates the student's ability to answer it. the oral exam provides the opportunity for early feedback on the dissertation project. the university of georgia offers the ph.d. in english with creative dissertation. the ph.d. is not a creative writing degree. rather, it gives students enrolled in an academic program the opportunity to do creative work. academic standards and program requirements for are the same for creative writing students as those for non-creative writing students (see above) with the following exception: creative writing students are expected to take at least one creative writing class per year (engl 6800 or 8800) as part of their required course work. 6800: topics in form and craft (3 hours---maximum 9 hours)---an exploration of topics and issues around the act of writing. sample courses include the first book of poetry, the art of translation, the art of the book, novel form, novel genres, and publishing and editing. 8800: seminar in creative writing (3 hours---maximum 9 hours for credit) advanced instruction in the craft of writing, including all genres, such as fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. please see the creative writing website for further information about the opportunities afforded to students who join us in the pursuit of their ph.d."
"unknown","the uga graduate program in english offers a full range of courses in american literary studies, including standard courses in literary periods, genres, and major authors, as well as topics courses; our approaches and methods are similarly diverse. we routinely offer author seminars on major writers (william faulkner, ernest hemingway, langston hughes), literary movements (e.g. \"the new york school poets,\" \"mid-century moderns\"), and approaches to american literature and popular culture (e.g. “constructions of race in the american novel”). seminar topics change frequently according to faculty research interests. in recent years our seminar offerings have included \"the harlem renaissance,\" \"american confessional poetry,\" \"the african american aesthetic,\" \"the southern renaissance and after,\" \"museums, modernism, memory,\" and \"encyclopedic form: the cantos and the arcades project.\" the american literature faculty are a large and diverse group whose research and teaching interests constitute one of the department's core strengths. we are particularly strong in american modernism, southern literature, and multicultural and african american literature. three of the department's chaired professors teach in american literature. in addition to faculty strengths, graduate students specializing in american literature have access to a rich array of department and university resources. our primary research facility is the main library, which houses the hargrett rare book and manuscript library . holdings in the hargrett include the manuscript collection ; the georgiana collection , documenting the history of georgia; the southeastern native american documents collection , an assortment of some 2000 documents and images from the years 1730-1842; the derenne georgia library , containing printed materials relating to the early history of georgia; a number of civil war diaries and related papers ; and an extensive broadside collection . the library's electronic resources include literature online, women writers online, american periodicals series online, american poetry 1600-1900, early american fiction 1789-1875, early american imprints 1639-1819, project muse, and jstor, all accessible through galileo , the libraries' database collection. two english department lecture series bring in a regular rotation of scholars in the field of american literature. the eidson lecture series, sponsored by j.o. eidson professor james nagel, and the lanier speakers series, sponsored by helen s. lanier professor jed rasula, have in recent years featured prominent americanists donald pizer, michael awkward, marjorie perloff, louis menand, and robert o'meally, among many others. the uga history department sponsors a regular colloquium series, the georgia workshop in early american history and culture . other colloquium series and reading groups are also available to students or faculty who wish to organize them. a number of ongoing faculty research projects provide students with opportunities to earn money while developing their own research, editorial and technical skills. graduate students most recently have worked on the writings of henry david thoreau ; the hemingway letters project ; the digital library of georgia and its related multicultural archives ; the annual review of literature, american literary scholarship ; the civil rights digital library initiative ; and various lecture series. in addition, uga graduate school research assistantships provide funding for graduate students to offer research help to american literature faculty who are writing books and articles. the varied demands of these assistantships bring valuable expertise to our students. at the same time, faculty encourage students to pursue their own research projects, and a combination of funding sources from the department, university, and graduate school makes it possible for students to attend national and international conferences and to travel to archives to conduct research for their theses and dissertations. a generous endowment from the hugh kenner professorship fund, established in 2006, enables graduate student travel: our first recipient visited the jack kerouac archives at the new york public library's berg collection; other sources have funded graduate student travel in the south to interview former civil rights activists. our students have recently presented papers at national and international conferences on henry james (venice, italy); ernest hemingway (ronda, spain); richard aldington (les saintes maries-de-la-mer, france); charles brockden brown (new york); robert penn warren (bowling green, ky); toni morrison (cincinnatti); and new directions in american indian research (chapel hill). they regularly present their work at the national meetings of the american literature association ( boston and san francisco ); the college language association ; twentieth-century literature and culture (louisville); and the annual mla convention. because of strong faculty encouragement and institutional support, our graduate students have been successful in publishing their work in prominent places. their dissertations have been published by ohio state university press, louisiana state university press, routledge, and the university of georgia press , among others. they have also published essays in important journals and edited collections. finally, the department offers many opportunities for advanced graduate students to teach undergraduate courses in american literature. working alone or as teaching assistants for professors, qualified graduate students may teach one of the sophomore american literature surveys and occasionally upper-division courses. the robert e. park postdoctoral teaching fellowship is awarded each year to our most qualified ph.d.s, providing graduates the opportunity to develop a full range of undergraduate courses."

"unknown","the phd in english literature with creative dissertation at the university of georgia is for writers who wish to advance their expertise and sophistication as scholars. our students are accomplished poets, fiction writers, essayists, translators, and interdisciplinary artists who are ready to move beyond the studio focus of the mfa to a more intensive program of literary study. over the course of the five-year program our students develop research specialties that complement their writing practice and prepare them professionally for a teaching career at the university or college level. our creative writing faculty are nationally and internationally recognized writers and translators with academic specializations in a variety of literary and theoretical fields, including genre theory, poetics, global literature, native american literature, african american literature, postcolonial literature, and translation studies. our program fosters serious conversations among our students about aesthetics and criticism, experience and culture, and politics and history—not only in the classroom but through public readings and lectures. our faculty and students play an active role in the cultural life of athens, both as artists and organizers. during the first two years of study our ph.d. candidates select from course offerings in the english department, seminars that signal both our faculty’s recognition of intellectual and disciplinary change and our abiding commitment to traditional literary history. each student takes at least one creative writing course a year in addition to courses in various literary specialties. a list of our department’s recent graduate course offerings can be found here . prior to beginning their third year, students prepare reading lists for comprehensive exams in three academic research fields of their choosing. every cwp student chooses “forms and craft” as one of their exam areas. this reading list serves as a research field unique to each writer’s approach to their particular genre. some of the “forms and craft” lists designed recently by cwp students include, “the midwestern novel”; “occult and visionary poetics”; “history of surrealism”; “monstrosity in epic poetry”; and “literary translation: theory and practice.” the two other exam fields should complement and expand the student’s areas of expertise beyond craft in order to broaden their historical and theoretical understanding of literature. in recent years, cwp students have elected to take exams in fields such as, “a global history of the novel,” ”modernism and the historical avant-garde,” “aesthetic theory,” ”african american literature,” “latinx literature,” “ecopoetics,” “the southern novel,” “lyric theory,” and “science fiction.” typically the exam committee is headed by a member of the creative writing faculty and two other professors from the department at large, experts in the respective exam areas. during the third year students read in preparation for written and oral exams. each written exam takes the form of a twenty-page written exhibit in which the student answers a directive question formulated in conjunction with the exam area’s director. this exhibit should demonstrate the student’s grasp of the field as a whole and serves as a demonstration of their ability to teach in this area at the undergraduate level. once the student has passed written exams, they are admitted to an oral exam overseen by the exam committee as a whole. once the student passes both oral and written exams, they are admitted officially to candidacy for the phd and begin working on their dissertation. during their fourth and fifth years cwp students complete a creative dissertation with a critical introduction. the dissertation typically is a full-length work in a single genre—a work of fiction, creative non-fiction, or poetry. the introduction is the author’s scholarly address to their audience. in the past students have used the introduction as a scholarly analysis of the state of the genre, a critical meditation on process informed by literary history, or a theoretical tracing of literary influence."

"unknown","i teach courses in literary and critical theory and twentieth-century literatures with a special emphasis on transnational modernism. over the last two decades, my research has been driven by a set of interrelated theoretical questions as i explored a wide range of historical and cultural phenomena. while the pursuit of these fundamental questions has guided me through several related academic fields (modernist studies, comparative literature, american studies, cold war studies, continental philosophy, and translation theory), the guiding light in these inquiries has always been the same concern with the political functions of literature amidst the permanent crises of modernity. i am currently in the process of exploring some new directions in my research as i have been doing more and more work in the fields of media philosophy and new media studies. my first book, the naked communist (fordham up, 2012), explores the ways literature participated in the constitution of the global imaginaries of early-cold war us mainstream culture in the 1950s. by dividing the globe into three separate “worlds,” this cultural imaginary tried to contain a historical crisis that, for the first time in the history of the west, threatened the entire globe with the real possibility of human extinction. i tried to demonstrate that in this historical context the idea of “modernism” was reconfigured to provide an ideological justification for a specific type of post-colonial imperialism whose long-term effects are still detectable today. the conclusions of this book set me on a broader research agenda that i am currently exploring in my current work. my second monograph, worldlessness after heidegger (edinburgh up, 2020), examines the way the concept of “worldlessness” has emerged in 20 th -century continental philosophy as the standard name for the epochal catastrophe that supposedly threatens us all with the loss of our humanity. according to this intellectual tradition, technological development, imperialism, globalization, the generalization of war-like conditions over the globe, and the looming threat of ecological disaster have created a historical situation in which humanity is simultaneously ever more technologically connected and is increasingly incapable of constructing a shared common “world.” this lost sense of a shared community, then, supposedly explains the rise of authoritarian political tendencies today. the book argues that some of the most influential intellectual innovations of the 20 th century like phenomenology, psychoanalysis, and deconstruction should be seen as fundamentally political responses to this historical situation and calls for affirmative definitions of “worldlessness.” in addition to traditional forms of academic literary and cultural criticism, i am also deeply committed to editing and translation. i got involved with editing while i was still a graduate student at suny/buffalo. i have always considered these opportunities to have been foundational experiences of my education as they showed me the force and necessity of creating intellectual communities around pressing contemporary questions. the book series, provocations , that i co-edit with marco abel for the university of nebraska press was conceived in the same spirit as it publishes short polemical interventions into contemporary academic debates. my theoretical interest in translation has always been rooted in the practice of translation, which has been my constant preoccupations for the entirety of my academic career. since it is impossible to separate the theory from the actual experience of translation, over the years i have also specialized in the translation of continental philosophy and critical theory. i am the translator and co-translator of three books: rodolphe gasché’s georges bataille: phenomenology and phantasmatology (stanford university press, 2012), peter szendy’s all ears: the aesthetics of espionage (fordham university press, 2017), and fethi benslama’s thinking revolution: writings on insubmission (co-translated with nathan gorelick, forthcoming from bloomsbury). other publications"

"unknown","dr. david mark diamond teaches and writes about eighteenth-century british literature and the early black atlantic, with particular emphasis on the role that religion plays in the formation of imperial global imaginaries. his current research examines literary responses to secularization, or the process by which christian belief came unbound from singular doctrinal orthodoxy and this newly liberalized religion was grafted more and more fully onto the european ambition of racialized planetary domination. in his first book, reading character after calvin: secularization, empire, and the 18th-century novel (university of virginia press, 2024), diamond revises and relates the histories of secularization, imperial race-making, and novelistic character. he argues that the surprising persistence and complexity of two-dimensional characterization in novels from the restoration to the romantic era index secularism’s disciplinary valence. flesh and spirit in need of domestication—errant beliefs and forms of life—manifest through, for example, the instability of allegorical personification or the physiognomic language of gothic faces. in simultaneity with spiritual excess or insufficiency, corporeal differences of sex and race are made to appear, and the intensifying, biopoliticized violence of empire made to appear justified. diamond's current book project, tentatively entitled \"before world religions: the politics of pluralism in eighteenth-century literature,\" reconstructs the literary pre-history of a core principle of modern liberal thought: pluralism. \"before world religions\" surveys eighteenth-century literary explorations of religious coexistence, c entering perspectives that stuart hall and ashley cohen have described as “black british,” an identity category that is inclusive of diasporan african and south asian writers and thus bridges two zones of empire. charles ignatius sancho, olaudah equiano, and sake dean mahomet, among other writers, model ways of thinking about differences of faith that neither ratify nor fully escape the logics of christian imperialism. they exemplify a regime still in formation, neither truly open nor constricted into the discipline it would become. eighteenth-century authors, therefore, offer not only a snapshot of political modernity as it was taking shape but also an opportunity to imagine counterfactual trajectories, dispositions of self and social arrangements that weren't realized in the moment but may be worth recuperating today."

the georgiana collection , documenting the history of georgia; the southeastern native american documents collection , an assortment of some 2000 documents and images from the years 1730-1842; the derenne georgia library , containing printed materials relating to the early history of georgia;

the hemingway letters project ; the digital library of georgia and its related multicultural archives ; the annual review of literature, american literary scholarship ; the civil rights digital library initiative ; and various lecture series. in addition, uga graduate school research assistantships provide funding for graduate students to offer research help to american literature faculty who are writing books and articles. the varied demands of these assistantships bring valuable expertise to our students. at the same time, faculty encourage students to pursue their own research projects, and a combination of funding sources from the department, university, and graduate school makes it possible for students to attend national and international conferences and to travel to archives to conduct research for their theses and dissertations. a generous endowment from the hugh kenner professorship fund, established in 2006, enables graduate student travel: our first recipient visited the jack kerouac archives at the new york public library's berg collection; other sources have funded graduate student travel in the south to interview former civil rights activists. our students have recently presented papers at national and international conferences on henry james (venice, italy); ernest hemingway (ronda, spain); richard aldington (les saintes maries-de-la-mer, france); charles brockden brown (new york); robert penn warren (bowling green, ky); toni morrison (cincinatti); and new directions in american indian research (chapel hill). they regularly present their work at the national meetings of the american literature association ( boston and san francisco );

"unknown","although often stereotyped as the “nation’s other,” the south has participated in every military conflict since the civil war, and like the nation, has been transformed by the rise of cities, multinational corporations, and webbed systems of transportation and communication. increasingly, it has interacted - as it always has - with the circumcaribbean, through trade, political ruptures and treaties, cultural exchanges, and mutual cultural influences, particularly music, art, and dance. concurrently, southerners have had transnational contacts with europe and africa, from the tragedy of the middle passage to this century’s of international exchanges of all kinds. as a crucial component of southern culture, southern literature has mapped histories of native americans, diasporic africans, colonization, slavery, immigration, agriculture, industrialization, and increasingly, urbanization. while the study of southern cultures once was concentrated in literature and history, it has expanded to include food studies, climate studies, race and gender studies, ethnic studies (especially african american and native studies), queer studies, and popular culture, which includes film, television, graphic works, music, and digital media. these developments have been absorbed by the “new southern studies,” which has generated many new approaches to the u.s. south and its larger configurations with the circumcaribbean, the hemisphere, and the atlantic world. critics such as richard gray, patricia yaeger, martyn bone, harriet pollack, thadious davis, jose limón, trudier harris, keith cartwright, anna brickhouse, gary richards and susan donaldson have put a new slant on the field of southern literature. also, the configuration of the u.s. south with the caribbean has brought in theoretical perspectives from figures such as édouard glissant, j. michael dash, valérie loichot, deborah cohn, and vincent pérez. historians such as david blight, marcus rediker, rebecca j. scott, matthew guterl, nell painter, michael trouillot, daniel heath justice, chadwick allen, and rod ferguson and others have reshaped our concepts of southern and circumcaribbean history. many uga students hail from the south, so this focus on its cultural history and heritage comprises a valuable and magnetic mirror, one that reflects the confluences, conflicts, and inheritance of a polyglot people. this southern studies concentration thereby offers a valuable foundation for negotiations with our nation’s present and futures."
"unknown","as timothy brennan argues, postcolonial studies brings together “globalizing features of world history and human societies” and “colonial practices and anticolonial challenges”. the interdisciplinary approach embraced by postcolonial studies provides a variety of academic tools and perspectives to study the social, cultural, and psychological aftermath of colonialism and the identity crisis generated in the wake of decolonization. independence efforts in the indian subcontinent following the world war ii as well as the grassroots movements targeting colonial regimes in northern africa have paved the way towards a rethinking of the power dynamics by challenging eurocentric and orientalist ways of defining the other. postcolonial theory disrupts western cultural and political hegemony by “giving natives the permission to tell their own stories”—as edward said puts it. an important aspect of this critical approach is to scrutinize the dehumanization and exploitation of the native under colonial rule (albert memmi, aime cesaire), the formation of national consciousness (bill ashcroft et al.), and the role of violence in establishing sovereign states as well as sovereign individuals (fanon). in addition, postcolonial studies sheds light on the complicated nature of contact zones that prepare the conditions for acculturation, interculturation, cultural synthesis and hybridity (walcott, brathwaite, bhabha) and bolsters discussions about “decoloniality” (mignolo) to complicate border studies. as postcolonial theory branches into other areas of academic investigation (such as diaspora studies, minority studies, subaltern studies, ethnic studies, etc.), it helps evaluate the shifting significations of “home”—for those who cross borders to abandon their homes of origin to adopt new ones, as well as those who remain in their “natural” homes only to witness significant transformations around them. as we enter the 21st century, postcolonial literature and theory helps reinvigorate recent debates on “world” and “global” literatures, neocolonialism, neoliberalism, decoloniliaty with an eye toward redefining humanism and secularism in new contexts."

"unknown","if you walked into the founders garden on the evening 13 nov., you might’ve mistaken it for a scene out of the great gatsby . hosted by the willson center, the founders house looked especially elaborate, flooding with a sea of well-dressed faculty, staff, and students from across several departments. and like a the great gatsby plotline (but with a much less tragic ending), the crowd discussed the profound impact that a certain, recently-retired someone had on their professional journeys. that someone is dr. william kretzschmar, harry and jane willson professor in humanities, who has decided to retire after a 38-year appointment at uga. funnily enough, dr. kretzschmar turned down his first job offer—not because he wasn’t interested—but because he needed more time to put together the best package to bring the linguistic atlas project from the university of chicago to athens. after accepting his second offer, dr. kretzschmar began his uga career in the fall of 1986. over those 38 years, he has watched uga evolve into what he considers a “great national university.” about 25 years ago, he also had the opportunity to become the university’s chief information officer and head of eits, but he preferred to teach instead. “what i have always liked best was my students and my research/writing, and english and linguistics at uga have let me do that for 38 years,” said dr. kretzschmar, “what more could anybody ask?” dr. william kretzschmar began his academic career as a medievalist, but has since become a linguist. in addition to his full-time appointment at uga, he also has an academic appointment at the university of oulu in finland. to say that his academic career is impressive would be an incredible understatement. just to name a few accomplishments on his 32-page, single-spaced cv, dr. kretzschmar has taught a wide variety of english and linguistics courses, published or co-written five books, and participated in countless boards and committees. but dr. kretzschmar thinks his greatest accomplishment is the students he has taught. during his time at uga, dr. kretzschmar directed 34 phd dissertations and many ma theses, but his approach has remained the same: to allow students to think for themselves and write what they were interested in. his students have continued their academic careers as professors, and decided to work in the digital humanities, or joined different sectors. “it is very rewarding indeed to have helped my students get a start on something that they wanted to do,” said dr. kretzschmar. although dr. kretzschmar is retiring from uga, he is not retiring from his academic life. he plans to continue travelling abroad to europe to give conference papers and teach, especially when he has invitations, like his next one in london this spring. dr. kretzschmar remarked, “i have written quite a few things but i have more to do: my projects are lined up like the planes getting ready to land in atlanta!” outside of park hall and outside of academia, dr. kretzschmar enjoys travelling, trying new restaurants, watching the braves and various football teams, and catching up on his favorite sci-fi and british detective shows. and lastly, he reads a lot. according to his last count, he has over 500 books on his kindle! dr. kretzschmar’s favorite hobby is to spend time with his family. he recalled how his sons would sometimes accompany him to his job when they were under the weather. fast forward some years later, dr. kretzschmar now spends time with his grandsons. it sounds like dr. kretzschmar will have a very cozy retirement with his loved ones. the people of park hall will miss dr. kretzschmar, but we hope he has a restful retirement!"

"unknown","dr. james howard is new to park hall. much of his previous research has focused on medieval and early modern literature, with his passion for that topic having begun in an undergraduate english class on british culture. recently, he has done research on writing center studies and says an important overall undercurrent for his work is play. “i am an avid tabletop and video game player with some sports experience (bowling, fencing), and i occasionally bounce ideas off of game studies to see what sticks. in short, i find myself frequently thinking about reading and writing as a player, looking to see what i can do with them,” howard said. the professional field of academia is nothing new to howard. his mother and two of his three siblings are teachers, while his father works as a trainer. their influence has been a source of inspiration. “when my mom went back to school to get her undergraduate degree to be a teacher (she was a nontraditional student), i asked her where her teachers (her professors) got their degrees,” he said. “i was fascinated by the idea of becoming a professor, which got into my head as a teacher of teachers.” the move to athens has been a big change for howard in many ways, as both the campus and the surrounding community provide more of a vibrant experience than he has had at other campuses. “uga has more to explore than i'm used to: more coffee shops, more sections in its libraries, more quiet buildings and reading spots, more lunch destinations. that is not to mention the many lovely people - students, colleagues - i've met and continue to meet,” he said. the most powerful part, overall, of academia and english for howard is the human connection, in fact. “what i value the most in academia is the sense of purpose centered on collaborative, lifelong learning. we learn through reading, talking to each other, writing, and teaching. i knew that, if i could center my work on that, i could keep doing it for a long, long time.”"
"unknown","if you have ever taken a yoga class, you may have heard an instructor use the term “find your edge,” referring to the place where comfort meets discomfort. for dr. elizabeth davis and a group of eleven intrepid undergraduates, that phrase captures the essence of their experience in a new domestic field study program, “writing & community at the georgia coast.” developed by dr. davis in collaboration with uga’s marine extension unit, and with support from a 2023 domestic field study fellowship and from the willson center’s culture & community partnership with the penn center historic district, the program was designed to create an immersive learning experience researching and writing in and for coastal communities. a longtime practitioner of service-learning in her courses, dr. davis was comfortable working with rural communities in georgia when marex came calling with a project idea that would bring student writers to the georgia coast. while she was in her element developing new academic classes and projects, designing and implementing a study away program pushed davis to her edge. budgets, travel logistics, health and safety planning, and student recruitment – the nuts and bolts of creating a study away program were complicated and, at times, frustrating. but the work came to fruition and the new program began enrolling students for maymester 2024. the class met on campus for the first four days of the term, reading articles and books on the history of the global atlantic, coastal geography and ecology, and oyster aquaculture. before they knew it, the time had come to depart athens and they set off, arriving at st. helena island, sc for their penn center residency. davis was excited to observe her students making themselves at home in the charming dormitories there, playing cards, sharing favorite music and movies, and relaxing at the dock after each busy day’s activities. again, though, davis and her students were pushed from their comfort zones as they absorbed history they had not been taught in school and learned about the ecological and economic challenges that threaten the future of sea island communities. but this foundation proved critical as the group moved on to their next destinations to learn more about the work that happens in uga facilities like the marine education center and shellfish research lab on skidaway island, the uga marine institute on sapelo island, and the marex field station in brunswick. students in the program challenged themselves to do new things: piloting a research vessel in the estuaries, recording data on the marine life hauled up in trawl nets, cooking meals, lugging gear, picking crab and heading shrimp, getting muddy in the salt marsh, and listening intently to community members’ stories of the past and concerns for the future. and all the while, they wrote - their own stories inspired by their travels, and stories of people and seafood that illuminate marex’s critical work supporting coastal communities. the opportunity to get outside the comfort of park hall proved invaluable. sophomore english major ava gruszczinski said, “i treasure the experiences i gained from this class and standing face to face with pioneers in the seafood industry and descendants of a beautiful gullah culture is something i will never forget.” what better place for english scholars, after all, than out in the world? gruszczinski sums it up well: “writing and community on the ga coast reminded me how much literature and storytelling can genuinely have an impact. english majors are not just writers—we are part of keeping legacies alive.”"
"unknown","a fter a year and a half of being a student in the english department, i am embarrassed to admit that i sometimes still get lost in park hall. with its well-worn staircases and confusing floorplan, i know i am not the only one. park hall certainly isn’t the flashiest or most sensical building, but there is a reason to its madness. its history explains some of its mystery. part of why park hall is so weird is partly due to its age. as a part of president franklin delano roosevelt’s new deal, the public works administration constructed park hall in 1939. park hall—the most up-to-date building at the time—was part of a uga expansion plan that also included the construction of leconte hall and baldwin hall. before it was home to the english department, park hall contained the department of physics. during uga’s growth spurt in the 1960s, the university planned to add an annex to park hall to provide additional space and new technology for its students and teachers. the annex was completed in 1970 and also provided women’s restrooms—that’s why they’re all on one side of the building! now, park hall houses both the english and classics departments. all undergraduates must take first-year writing courses, so most students have entered park hall at some point. in 1946, the building was named after the late robert emory park, who served as the english department head from 1900-1942 (yes, you read that correctly!). but information about robert park is scant. even his great-grandson, richard stephen (steve) monday, has found difficulty in learning about his ancestor. thankfully, a 1957 article from the georgia review provides some insight into the park hall namesake: robert emory park was born to emma bailey and james fletcher park in tuskegee on 11 december, 1868. he enrolled in west point military academia in 1888, but resigned after eighteen months due to an injury. when he returned home, he attended the university of alabama, where he received a.b. and a.m. degrees. before he arrived at uga in 1900, park taught at gainsville high schools and married mary belle whelchel, who belonged to a prominent north georgia family. in addition to his forty-year tenure as head of the english department, park studied at oxford university for a year, travelled in europe, and received an honorary doctorate from ua. he was also a member of the methodist church, the democratic party, and several fraternities. the article speaks highly of robert e. park--describing his character as accomplished and disciplined, but gentle-natured. he had a warm personality and was dedicated to his students’ education and well-being. as edwin m. everett writes, “professor park's great strength was not in scholarship sort but in his humanity. like most of his colleagues, he gave little or no time to the composition of scholarly learned journals; he gave his time instead to his reading and to his students” sources: rebecca hopper and akela reason. \"park hall .\" clio: your guide to history. may 2, 2019. accessed december 11, 2024. https://theclio.com/entry/77109 everett, edwin m. “robert e. park: professor old style.” the georgia review , vol. 11, no. 4, 1957, pp. 369–79. jstor , http://www.jstor.org/stable/41395464. accessed 11 dec. 2024."
"unknown","the annual commencement and awards ceremony of the department of english is always an exhilarating experience. the happy faces of family members in attendance, along with the gratified countenances of the graduates and the award recipients, just seem to make everything glow. not to mention the weather, perfect as usual in early may in athens. also perfect was our keynote speaker. the english department’s class of 2016 was honored by the presence of alumnus jack bauerle, whose memories of park hall as an english major forty-some years ago were a vivid reminder of just how hallowed a place it is. those in attendance were thrilled to share the memorable occasion with coach bauerle, who was head coach of the women’s swim team at the 2008 olympics and whose stewardship of the uga swim team has netted many national and sec championships, (as i write this he is at the swim trials in omaha in preparation for the olympics in rio di janeiro.) thank you, coach bauerle, for inspiring our graduating class this year! this year we have much to celebrate. for the second year in a row, an english professor was recipient of the michael f. adams early-career scholarship award. this year it was cody marrs. ed pavlic was recognized with the christ-janer creative research award, the fourth time this has been granted to a faculty member from our department (out of fifteen total). ed also entered the ranks of distinguished research professor, one of the highest distinctions at the university of georgia; he is its first recipient from our department in the long history of this award, which began in 1983. dr. pavlic has had a banner year. his poetry collection, let’s let that are not yet: inferno was published as a winner of the national poetry series and on the scholarly front, his book who can afford to improvise? james baldwin, black music, and the listeners came out almost at the same time. as returning director of the creative writing program, ed’s bifocal and multilateral interests and accomplishments are indicative of the ingredients that make our doctoral program in creative writing one of the top in the nation. adding kudos to creative writing faculty, magdalena zurawski’s book companion animal was recently awarded the norman farber first book award from the poetry society of america. another highlight of the commencement ceremony was the generosity of english alumnus mary hutcherson, whose h. grady hutcherson memorial scholarship fund provided awards to four deserving undergraduates. with the decline of state funding for public universities in georgia and across the country, the role played by the munificence of benefactors is more urgent—and appreciated—than ever. the department of english thrives with the support of its various endowed professorships and other endowments. this year, for example, the british women writers conference received support from the lanier, the sterling-goodman, and the eidson chairs. on a concluding note, i want to salute another benefactor whose generosity will bring significant opportunities for students, faculty, and programs, both now and in the future. mary anne hale has created the paul douglas (doug) hale learning enhancement fund in memory of her husband. in recognition of this endowment, park 265, the large lecture hall, will be named in commemoration of doug hale, who earned both a ba and ma in english and taught english literature in several colleges and universities before embarking on a stellar career in television and film. a loyal and consistent donor, doug stayed in touch with his alma mater. a decade ago doug returned to park hall on one of his annual trips here (he was a native athenian) and gave a memorable talk in that very room, one soon to be named the hale lecture hall. he was a raconteur who would have made mark twain proud, and he possessed an outsized curiosity about everything under the sun. it is always a pleasure to meet veterans of park hall, but doug was one of a kind. those of us who knew him will miss his wit, his appetite for life, and his booming voice, but thanks to mary anne hale’s generous memorial gift, he will continue to have a positive impact on the department of english. jed rasula department head photo credit: dr. sara steger"

"unknown","this year has seen a wave of centenary celebrations commemorating the avant-garde movement known as dada. as author of a recent history of dada, i’ve been giving talks on the subject across the country to standing room only audiences, and wondering what it is that compels such interest in this relentlessly iconoclastic movement. one of the dadaists accused art of being “a large-scale swindle.” the swindle was not financial, but ethical. “the dadaist considers it necessary to come out against art, because he has seen through its fraud as a moral safety valve.” accordingly, “dada is forever the enemy of that comfortable sunday art which is supposed to uplift man by reminding him of agreeable moments.” this sounds severe, yet it’s demonstrably the case that dada won (“dada siegt” was a common rallying cry: dada triumphs), at least in the art world. visit any museum and it’s unlikely you’ll see a straightforward (let alone consoling) portrait of grandma on display. in literature it seems different, until we remind ourselves that we don’t even need to make a special effort to stock our syllabuses with texts that caper and taunt, disoblige, harass, and generally refrain from “uplift.” after the harrowing misadventures chronicled in ralph ellison’s invisible man, the novel ends with the unsettling insinuation by its african american protagonist: “on the lower frequencies, i speak for you.” or consider virginia woolf’s wry observation in a room of one’s own: “women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size.” these statements are a constant reminder of the extravagant potentiality of literature. “i cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation of a true expression,” quipped henry david thoreau in walden, a book rife with semantic shenanigans. no wonder (one might be tempted to observe) people are wary of literature and art, both of which flamboyantly refuse to comply with heartfelt sentiments and good taste. we are now deep into one of those periodically recurring features of american life in which there’s a seismic shift in focus by students and their families. in its aggregate form, this is known as a flight from the humanities. the past decade has seen an over-enrollment in certain subjects (law, business); this over-enrollment has led to a market glut and the subsequent challenge of employability for those who had degrees they’d presumed to be tickets to solvency. what this pattern reveals is that education (besides being, well, education) is a bet, a wager on the future. do you put your chips on the roulette wheel options of english, or engineering, studio art, animal husbandry, pharmacy? amidst the flight from humanities, the number of english majors here at uga remains what it was a decade ago, though it’s dropped dramatically elsewhere. these contested numbers reflect well on our department. it means we deliver the goods, as the saying has it. but what are the goods? in the old-timey school formula—reading, writing, and ’rithmetic—we deliver two of the three. but it’s not that simple. there’s also a lot of history that comes into play (after all, history is not exclusive to the history department any more than written english is exclusive to us). and there’s psychology, and sociology, and philosophy, and … but why enumerate, when the fact is that literature encompasses anything and everything? one thing that literature definitely does not do is pander to your own views and biases. literature steers a wide berth around what’s been called “homophily,” described as “a tendency to listen to and associate with people like yourself, and to exclude outsiders.” this is from an article on the viral agency of social networks, “ war goes viral: how social media is being weaponized ” by emerson t. brooking and p. w. singer (in the november 2016 issue of the atlantic). i write this a few days after the national election, which revealed (on both sides) the peril of hearing only one’s own perspective bounce back from homophilic support systems like echolocation for bats. yet this singular event has revealed yet another strength of an english department: the care and solicitation our professors have for students who are bewildered, dismayed, afraid, or outright grieving over the results. i wouldn’t normally have listed grief counseling among the services we provide, but i’m not surprised that it has come to that. what this phenomenon reflects is the fact that in english classes students are being constantly exposed to the light and the dark of human endeavor, the sad and the happy, viciousness and beneficence, pluck and luck. there is no preordained response to the books we read, but there’s almost always a response, because stories and novels, poems and plays make a claim on us. collectively, it’s called literature not because it has “passed the test of time” but because it doesn’t claim attention as merchandise. we don’t read what we read because it’s popular (moby-dick was such a flop it effectively ended melville’s career as a writer, but many would now list it as their favorite book, including me). we read these things because they provide access to another world that is strangely like this world yet, like alice going into wonderland, once we’re inside we’re likely to find ourselves bemused, horrified, delighted, indifferent, but always learning. the appetite for learning is what all the humanities provide. i have no doubt that all the departments and programs at a university have the potential to arouse that appetite, but i also know that it’s often beside the point when students choose a major based on some dim expectation of employability. that can put a real damper on the learning process, which then feels like studying up for a driver’s license. the humanities give us something altogether different, and i’d put it this way: you can never pass the test. and that’s because there’s no test; there’s just life—and learning, with all its pleasures, irritants, and absorbing challenges. i’ll end with a haunting provocation from robert frost. in 1962, the year before he died, he gave a talk at dartmouth college called “on extravagance.” by extravagance he meant that little twist artists give to the raw material provided by the world, the twist of as if. much of the talk is just frost reading his poems, albeit with the startling disclosure that they’re “just loaded, loaded, with politics.” really?—by the author of “birches,” “mending wall,” “stopping by woods on a snowy evening”? but here’s where it gets interesting. “i’ve been thinking lately that politics is an extravagance,” he suggests, “an extravagance about grievances. and poetry is an extravagance about grief. and grievances are something that can be remedied, and griefs are irremediable, you know. and there you take them with a sort of a happy sadness.” - dr jed rasula, department head and helen s. lanier distinguished professor of english"
"unknown","once again, spring has come — and gone already, having arrived as early as january. by the time commencement ceremonies were underway around campus, the usual cornucopia of blooms was long past. and once again, the english department commencement marked the passage of another graduating class. talking to parents of my students afterward was a special treat, and one of them observed that nearly all the students were women. “that’s true,” i replied. of the fifty-four who participated in the ceremony, there were only five guys (which, coincidentally, is the name of a burger joint downtown across from the arch of countless photo-ops). in fact, i had recently tallied the gender profile of students in our spring term courses. of eighty-three classes, only eight had gender parity, while twenty-nine had a ratio of 10 to 1 (female to male). the picture that emerges is even more extreme when we look at upper division courses, since only majors can take those. of our forty-eight 4000 level courses this spring, only four had gender parity, while seventeen of them had a ten to one ratio. basically then, it’s clear that female english majors are the great majority: only one or two of ten is male. how does this relate to the gender profile of the faculty? retirements tell the story. this year we bade farewell to doug anderson, simon gatrell, and fred dolezal, who were preceded in retirement last year by hugh ruppersburg and charlie doyle. in fact, the only woman who has retired in the past eight years was the late judith ortiz cofer. with five men gone in the past two years, gender parity in the faculty is finally a reality. and so it is fitting that the next department head will be michelle ballif, who will succeed me in august. it’s certainly a good thing that young women, who form the great majority of our majors, see so many accomplished women in the faculty. but gender disparity in english means there’s disparity elsewhere, and this has the potential to replicate old stereotypes in worrisome ways. if the “hard” sciences and the “worldly” schools like business and engineering are predominately male, a tacit signal seeps out from the university, suggesting that some fields, like literary studies, have become a kind of “woman’s work.” such social maladjustments are reflected in the even more worrisome statistics about the profession. in the chronicle of higher education in february 2017, kevin birmingham addressed “‘ the great shame of our profession’: how the humanities survive on exploitation .” the gist of his alarming parade of statistics include the following: (1) tenured faculty now represent only 17% of college instructors, (2) between 1975 and 2011, the number of part-time instructors quadrupled, (3) 35% of part-time instructors live at or below the poverty line, and (4) no less than 61% of part-time instructors are women. these figures are alarming. fortunately, they are not replicated here at the university of georgia, but a single institution can’t hold out forever against national trends. as i’ve indicated in previous columns, these are hard times for the humanities, and we recently saw the president recommend complete defunding of the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities. fortunately, congress did not accept his recommendation, but the threat remains. hard times is one thing; extinction is something else altogether. a classic of american history is richard hofstadter’s 1963 book anti-intellectualism in american life , with its bracing chronicle of everything you’d imagine from the title. but hofstadter was sensitive to the fact that the united states, as a democracy, has always needed to audition alternative voices, other perspectives; the intellectuals had no guaranteed stake in the outcome of public issues. but in times like these, we intellectuals occupy an increasingly precarious ground, recently made even more precarious in georgia by the governor’s signing into law the “campus carry” bill permitting concealed weapons on campus. as maureen downey’s “get schooled” blog for the atlanta constitution-journal reported earlier in may , an open records request revealed that the tally of calls against the bill in the 2017 legislative session was 14,873, while the number of those in favor was 145. no typo: the discrepancy is that extreme. it gives the phrase “special interests” a whole new profile, doesn’t it? we have legitimate interests as well, but apparently not special enough to count . i’d like to end on an uplifting note, but public events are shouting louder than a head’s column can aspire to. the most i can offer is a reflection on what it is we do, which is not correcting grammar and spelling (as so many people i’ve encountered on plane trips fear, when they find out i’m an english professor). we teach the whole complex world depicted in literary works, in which it’s clear that the skullduggery we face in the world today is nothing new. but it’s worth knowing there is historical precedent; it’s important to have access to other minds in other times, contending with the same traumas that seem so unprecedented today. but there’s a risk in the assessment as well, and i turn in conclusion to a warning ventured by the eminent scholar george steiner prefacing his book language and silence in 1970 (another moment of acute political trauma): “to think of literature, of education, of language, as if nothing very important had happened to challenge our very concept of these activities seems to me unrealistic,” he wrote with tactful restraint. “to read aeschylus or shakespeare—let alone to ‘teach’ them—as if the texts, as if the authority of the texts in our own lives, were immune from recent history, is subtle but corrosive illiteracy.”"
"unknown","“i don’t know,” i had to admit. that was my blush-faced response to the professor—and to the class of undergraduates enrolled in arhi 3002, “greek art and architecture,” a course in which i, also a professor, was likewise a student. i remember the slow-motioned moments before that painful admission: sitting in one of those uncomfortable desks, attentively viewing the slides, studiously taking notes, and hearing the professor call out: “dr. ballif? what greek sophist is this statue representing?” i had no idea. a long silence was my immediate response. as the proverbial deer in headlights, i could only stare back blankly, and then, finally, when the dead silence became too heavy, mumble, “i don’t know.” “demosthenes,” she announced to the class, and i registered her disappointment; i had been introduced to the class as a scholar of the sophists. yet in defense of my ignorance, i quickly told myself, had she given me a text , such as “on the crown,” i might have had a fighting chance to respond differently. that is, i don’t exactly plaster my office walls with posters of the sophists. i’m not an expert on the visual representations of their likenesses, and more to the point, i’m not an expert on classical statuary. however, years later, i still feel a need to defend my ignorance. yet isn’t “not knowing” precisely the reason for being a student? indeed, wasn’t that the reason that i chose to become an apprentice of classical art and architecture, so that i could learn what i didn’t know? in 2002, i was fortunate to be awarded the coveted study in a second discipline fellowship. as my primary discipline is rhetorical theory, i wanted to study in a second discipline—that of ancient art and aesthetics. my aim was to follow my desire to examine resonances between the principles of ancient rhetoric and ancient aesthetics, including principles of symmetry, perspective, proportion. so i found myself in the position of a student, humbled by my ignorance. but this was no new position for me—nor for the other faculty of the english department. we are, all of us, students. you might say that being a student is our profession. we are students of language, of texts; it is our profession to engage with that which we don’t know. like many of our students, as faculty, we find ourselves fighting deadlines, finishing writing projects in the wee hours of the night, and dreading our work being “graded” or otherwise reviewed or evaluated. but being a student is what faculty do for a profession. i realize that most people think professors profess (that is, teach), but they also learn (that is, do research). this research may, it is hoped, result in publications, but it most certainly results in enriched teaching. our faculty are constantly seeking out learning opportunities. during 2017, for example, thirty of our faculty members went to approximately 85 conferences, where they not only presented their own research, but also learned from presentations from their peers. further, our faculty attended longer, educational “camps”: professor andrew zawacki, for example, spent time as a fellow at the atelier viceversa, atlas/ collège international des traducteurs littéraires, arles, france, in a week-long intensive translation session with a dozen other french-to-english translators. professor cynthia camp attended a specialized seminar, “understanding the medieval book,” in medieval codicology at the university of south carolina. professor maggie zurawski participated in the week-long paros poetry and translation symposium. professor roxanne eberle participated in a neh institute on advanced topics in digital humanities at the university of pittsburgh, “make your edition: models and methods for digital textual scholarship.” the point i am making is this: our faculty are busying themselves with the business of learning. further examples are detailed in this newsletter: for example, our faculty apply to participate in the study in a second discipline program and seek out various “fellow” programs available on campus, such as the service learning fellows, the online learning fellows, and the writing fellows. a number of our faculty have been selected as fellows of the russell special collection libraries fellow program (see the feature on professor john lowe in this newsletter). professor elizabeth kraft has researched materials like maps in the archives to introduce to her early eighteenth-century literature class, materials which nicely illustrate the themes and motifs in robinson crusoe. other faculty members have also been selected for this program. professor cynthia camp developed her medieval manuscript course so that students could work intensely on an advanced research group project on a single medieval book owned by uga, the hargrett hours. professor camp articulates what she learned from this experience: “what i learned the most from the fellows program was how to think like a librarian: getting a professional's perspective on how what processes they go through during acquisitions and cataloging, the logic behind the cataloguing system, and their vision of best practices during a library instructional visit.” professor nancee reeves similarly describes what she learned: “before my fellowship, i just turned my students loose in the archive library, with little direction, thinking the ‘joy of discovery’ would take over. however, an archive library is quite different than a regular library or even a museum. they need direction, they need to learn the tricks of using a complex system, and they need to know the protocol. for my students to learn, i first needed to learn, which was as much about how to use as archive library as the material in it.” my point, and i do have one, is this: our faculty are students as well; they know the pain of spending hours and hours composing work; they know the anxiety of being evaluated, the feeling of not knowing. and of admitting it. and of embracing it. indeed, i am suggesting that for all of us, being a student is to acknowledge the limits of our knowledge, to extend a gesture of hospitality toward the unknown, and to state without embarrassment, “i don’t know.” passionate learners make effective teachers. at our recent graduation and awards ceremony, which honored our graduating students, we were able to acknowledge the excellence of our students with a number of awards and scholarships, made possible by generous endowments. we were also able to acknowledge the excellence of a professor in our department. the martha munn bedingfield teaching award was established to recognize a faculty member of the department of english for the pursuit of excellence in teaching—to a faculty member who has made a distinct difference in the intellectual lives of students through effective and creative instruction and course development. this year, the award went to dr. eric morales-franceschini. in one of the many nominating letters received, one student characterized professor morales-franceschini’s pedagogical influence as such: he has fostered my growth as a student and as a thinker. he has accomplished this first through his passion for the subject-matter he teaches and his ability to transfer this passion to his students. i have never had a professor who has emboldened me more to tackle difficult texts and to examine them critically. his teaching style encourages students to wrestle with the most challenging questions of the texts, teaching us to ask these questions ourselves in our own readings. i know i would not have been able to grow as much as a writer and a critical thinker if i did not have dr. morales-franceschini as a professor, encouraging me and inspiring me to aim higher, to write more ambitiously. we appreciate the martha munn bedingfield endowment, which honors a long-time educator and allows us to acknowledge professor morales-franceschini’s expertise as a passionate teacher who encourages students to embrace the unknown, to tarry with the questions that challenge us. we are also grateful for our other donors who provide support to our students. most recently, bill and melissa prigge have funded a scholarship in honor of their son, william, who graduated with both an undergraduate and graduate degree in english from the university of georgia. we hope their generosity inspires you, and we hope that you consider contributing to the english department’s threefold mission of teaching, research, and community research. make an online gift now the english department fund provides essential support to the department’s research, instruction, and public outreach."
"unknown","t.s. eliot famously named april the “cruellest month” in his poem the waste land (1922), although certainly any month that marks the loss of a friend and colleague is the cruellest of all. this past summer, the department of english experienced such a loss when professor christy desmet died july 25, 2018, rendering that month a very cruel month, indeed. a scholar of both early modern literatures and rhetoric and composition, christy desmet joined the english department faculty in 1984, and in addition to her teaching, research, and editorial contributions, she served for approximately two decades as director of our award-winning first-year composition program. possessing an intractable will, she was often stubborn, yet easily moved to laughter. fundamentally, professor desmet was fiercely protective of those under her care—and she cared for legions, including her beloved husband, david schiller, and all of her family, friends, colleagues, and students—her graduate students and every student in a first-year writing class. in addition to her many accomplishments, under her leadership, the first-year composition program was awarded the university system of georgia regents teaching excellence award for departments and programs (2012). dr. desmet’s prowess as a writing instructor was most recently recognized this past spring at the annual conference on college composition and communication, where she, robby nadler (then assistant director of uga’s writing center), and kristen miller (director of biological sciences) received the council on basic writing innovation award for uga’s science writing project, a collaboration between the first-year composition program, uga’s writing center, the division of biological sciences, and the writing intensive program. the department of english prides itself on its contribution to writing instruction at the university of georgia, and professor desmet consistently did us proud. this newsletter is dedicated to her memory. the christy desmet memorial fund has been established to support graduate students working in british literature prior to 1900. to support this fund, please visit: gail.uga.edu/christydesmet or send a check payable to the “christy desmet memorial fund” to the franklin college of arts and sciences, attn. kate arnold, 124 old college, uga, athens, ga 30602. as we ponder this loss, we simultaneously celebrate the achievements of all our faculty and students, who work tirelessly to accomplish much—as noted in this newsletter. we also welcome to the department the very capable shaina patel, as the administrative specialist in the head’s office, and professor jason payton, as a recent faculty hire in early american literature (both featured in this newsletter). in a future newsletter, we will also introduce and formally welcome two, additional recent hires: joshua kuyrkendall (facilities coordinator) and dr. joshua king (lecturer), serving as interim associate direct of first-year composition. additionally, we publicly thank dr. deborah miller for assuming the position of interim director of the first-year composition program, while we conduct a current national search. we also celebrate the generous gifts of our donors, including professor emeritus hugh ruppersburg and tricia ruppersburg for their endowment to the undergraduate literary magazine, stillpoint, as well as announce a new scholarship for an exceptional graduate student in american literature, named for professor emeritus hubert mcalexander and retired professor pat mcalexander. this scholarship will be awarded for the first time at our spring graduation ceremony in may. we also memorialized our large classroom, park 254, as the doug hale lecture hall in recognition of the gift of his widow, mary anne hale. sending best wishes for a restorative holiday break, and for a regenerative new year—where hope may spring, eternally. michelle ballif professor and head"
"unknown","i routinely teach the undergraduate course, “literary theory,” in which we study contemporary approaches to the interpretation of texts. as the course isn’t focused on one genre of literature or one particular historical period, i encounter students from multiple backgrounds, and i relish the opportunity to engage the complex minds in my class as we explore complex ideas together. at the risk of revealing my peculiar threshold of entertainment, when i was in graduate school a hundred years ago, my cohort of students used to host a simulacrum of academic conferences, and assign ourselves papers to deliver, using theoretical frames to critique popular tv shows, such as: a feminist reading of bonanza ; a marxist reading of gilligan’s island ; a deconstructive reading of hawaii five-o. (clearly, i am dating myself; some who read this will also recognize when their references to popular culture receive blind stares.) but i have incorporated this scholarly play into my classroom, to encourage a sense of adventure, to underscore how interpretive strategies can be employed variously, in order to provide rich readings of texts. i call this exercise the “lit crit blowout.” at least, i smile. the point of this message is to highlight the intellect, curiosity, and ingenuity of our students. one of these “literary theory” students, astra taylor, went on to write several books, including examined life and an accompanying dvd of the same title, which interviews key theorists and asks them—as the title suggests—how concerns of justice, truth, and meaning, for example, inflect our readings. of our graduates this year, i have had the pleasure of learning from the interpretive work of students including keamber farley, alex williams, ellen everitt, lukas woodyard, rachel dier, mk manoylov, and julia koslowsky. but many more students have graced my rolls over the years. each student has in his/her own way become a teacher—whether in the lit crit blowouts, in papers, or in contributions to the department and world more generally. our students regularly do such work, as our newsletter highlights. we proudly send our students out into the world, and they do us proud, in return. sadly, we have to also witness the exit of our company from this world. we acknowledge the death of former department head, dr. coburn freer, who passed on february 26, 2019, and who is survived by his wife of 57 years mona; daughters meagan and elinor and their husbands dan and david; and five grandchildren. he is also survived by a brother and sister-in-law, frank and susan freer, a half-sister toni and nieces mary ellen and diane. a memorial tribute is included in this newsletter. but we have much to celebrate. at our 2019 honors celebration in may, we recognized a number of students for their excellence, and inaugurated three new awards. nele langhof was awarded the prigge family scholarship, donated in the name of george william and melissa prigge’s son, william, who graduated with both bachelor and master’s degrees in english literature from uga in 2014. we also recognized paula rawlins as recipient of the mcalexander award in american literature, gifted by patricia mcalexander, who retired as a professor from uga’s division of developmental studies and academic enhancement, and hubert mcalexander, a legendary professor emeritus of our department and a celebrated author, having received widespread praise for biographies of authors peter taylor and sherwood bonner. and finally, sarah mayo was the recipient of the christy desmet graduate fellowship in british literature to 1900, in memoriam of professor desmet’s legacy in renaissance scholarship, as well as her ground-breaking work in shakespeare appropriation studies. she was also a scholar of rhetoric/composition and digital humanities, and administered the department’s award-winning first-year composition program for twenty years. the department is profoundly grateful for these gifts. dr. esra santesso received the 2019 bedingfield excellence in teaching award. martha munn bedingfield was an educator who touched thousands of lives across the vidalia community, and the award in her name recognizes a department faculty member who has made a distinct difference in the intellectual lives of students. one of the multiple students who nominated dr. santesso for the award wrote: “dr. santesso encourages her students to keep questioning, to join larger, interdisciplinary conversations, and to strive for excellence in and out of the classroom.” even as athens slows down to its summer pace, we'll be in park hall awaiting next year's students, who will bring with them their passion for learning, literature, and language."
"unknown","welcome to 2020! there is much to celebrate at this time, as the many and various accomplishments of our departmental faculty and students in this newsletter detail. and, although not an official anniversary, this new decade marks, roughly, the advent of the department of english at the university of georgia, approximately one hundred years ago. according to several historical records, as recounted by former franklin college senior associate dean, hugh ruppersburg, our department, as such, came into existence around 1915, with women joining the uga student body in 1918. although the university was founded in 1785, the focus of the curriculum at the university of georgia was on the study of greek, latin, logic, and moral, natural and political philosophy. occasionally, a professor would lecture on contemporary literature, or “belles lettres,” as it was known at the time, but until the turn of the century, uga’s “english” professors had no community of either colleagues or students. in a reaction to a national controversy over the value of teaching literature in the “mother tongue of our everyday life,” georgia’s board of trustees voted in the late 1800s that the teaching of english should be given more prominence, and so finally our community of scholars and students was given official sanction, as well as the institutional support to sustain us. over the past 100 years, we’ve grown in size, stature, and scope, offering much to support the study of “belles lettres,” that is characteristic of the department of english. we continue our work as writers, scholars, and students of literature and the english language, both inside and outside of park hall, and we invite you to read about our most recent endeavors in this first newsletter of 2020."
"unknown","dear friends and colleagues of the english department: whether an overstatement, understatement, or an example of hyperbole or litotes, it can be said that this fall semester was not. as. expected. as we each nod our heads in affirmation, tickling the memory files of our days, months, years of what will become 2020, we are simultaneously, pleasantly tickled to learn that the joy and energy that motivates our faculty and students to pursue scholarship in english studies remains steadfast. open this newsletter, and you will see how new doors are being opened in this historical moment, as drs. joshua king and caroline young detail in their featured note about teaching in prisons, or how students discuss their experiences learning to adjust to new pedagogical environments. you’ll also see how the work that we do continues: books continue to be published, new faculty continue to join us, and—alas—much-respected faculty retire. we send all best wishes for a hopeful 2021—full of promise, joy, and health for all. michelle ballif professor and head"
"unknown","dear friends of the department of english: as ever – but particularly in this moment of exception – we hope this newsletter finds you well. we are proud to share with you the successes of our students and faculty, and especially to highlight our recent graduates and award winners. although pandemic conditions necessitate our physical separation, we gather here virtually to celebrate accomplishments, to acknowledge the hard work that both students and faculty have undertaken in these past months to transition to online instruction, learning, and support, as well as to recognize the ways in which all have continued to produce smart and sophisticated work in troubled times. we also want to acknowledge the retirement of two of our faculty, who have served the department for decades: professor elizabeth kraft and professor ron balthazor. their contributions to our department, to the university, and the greater profession have been many, and they will be sorely missed. additionally, i want to acknowledge all of our donors. indeed, the bulk of the awards bestowed are a result of generous donations, gifted to us in the names of former faculty, students, and friends of the department of english. we express our deep appreciation to all our current—and—future donors. before you read on about the successes of our students and faculty, i want to express my appreciation for all of our faculty, our program coordinators, their administrative assistants, our support staff in the department—and, of course, the contributors to this newsletter. there are many in our department who generously give of their time and talent, including—but not limited to—professor esra santesso and professor richard menke. both have served the department with dedication during the past six years in their respective administrative positions of associate head and undergraduate coordinator. as they step back from these administrative demands, other faculty members have stepped up to assume these positions: professor roxanne eberle will become the new associate head and professor casie legette will serve as the undergraduate coordinator. the work done in such administrative positions, along with the work of their support staff, is often invisible, but is essential to ensuring the conditions of possibility for our individual and collective success. once again: congratulations to our award winners and to the graduates of the class of 2020!"
"unknown","as part of our core mission statement, the department of english is proud to offer students “a sympathetic participation in the verbal worlds of other times and places, drawing on the full range of linguistic tools, historic knowledge, and interpretive experience at our disposal.” aiming to “allow our students to enhance their appreciation of expressive possibility,” we hope to develop “a sophisticated, practical grasp of the central role that language plays in the preservation of human institutions”—and relations, i would add. one of the courses i regularly teach, literary theory, introduces students, as the course title suggests, to a variety of contemporary theories that help us interpret literature. these theories also invite ethical implications for how one chooses to “be in the world.” we each make many choices every day, but choices always have consequences. one of the theorists we read, martha nussbaum, for example, discussed the importance of mutual care as a foundation for justice. to me, this idea highlights the lived experience that we are each brought into this world, absolutely dependent on the care of others. as a corollary, subsequently, we have the responsibility for others, as well. as many of you don’t know, i live on a farm, and i well know the responsibilities of caring for, nurturing, and sustaining all under my care. this “response-ability,” as scholar diane davis notes, means we have an ethical obligation to respond to the other, insofar as we are able. we respond when anyone calls us—not necessarily in a moment of distress, but when someone says our name or when a stranger hails us. that is: when called, even metaphorically, i turn; i respond , as responsibly as i am able, because i acknowledge that there are many who have nurtured me and provided opportunity for me. this response becomes the answer to the call to be responsible to these others. the faculty and students in the department of english enact these commitments of care—they may be in the form of philanthropy (please read about professor emerita elizabeth kraft’s newly endowed scholarship to students) or in the forms of scholarship that enliven new conversations about historical and national periods (see the feature on dr. rodrigo paula martini) or in the form of welcoming scholars to campus to discuss the relations between racial representations and cultural productions (see the feature on dr. joshua hussey). the department of english houses many faculty and staff who share a commitment of care, and we send not only a generous message of concern to our graduating students, but also a welcoming hand to our present and future students. all best, michelle ballif"
"unknown","although a shake of the magic 8-ball earlier this academic year might have predicted otherwise, we conclude the semester with much to celebrate! we are proud to recognize our approximately 120 graduating a.b. students and 8 graduating m.a. and ph.d. students, who succeeded in less-than-ideal circumstances. likewise, we are proud to recognize all in our department who teach our students: graduate teaching assistants, instructors, and faculty, who dedicate time and invest care in creating the conditions of success for our students—as ever, but especially during this past difficult year, when pedagogical means and ends were necessarily re-envisioned. we also express our gratitude to members of our departmental staff, who spent hours preparing the building for pandemic conditions, whilst still assuming their normal responsibilities, such as handling budgetary matters and advising students. although the academic year may have ended, we are busy preparing for our fall semester. returning students may note that park hall has received a fresh lick of paint on the walls and should surely appreciate several renovated bathrooms. fall semester will also welcome new faculty members: joshua hussey and emily robinson, who have been hired as lecturers to assist primarily with the first-year writing program. dr. hussey has previously worked in our first-year writing program as an instructor, as well as taught as a brittain fellow at the georgia institute of technology. dr. robinson recently received her phd from arizona state university in writing, rhetorics, and literacies. we welcome them both and are confident they will continue our teaching mission with distinction. the department of english is committed to student success, as attested by our faculty’s accomplishments. for example: dr. nancee reeves received this year’s franklin college excellence in undergraduate education award; dr. roxanne eberle, our associate head, received the bedingfield excellence in teaching award; dr. sujata iyengar, in collaboration with national associations, worked to decolonize or re-indigenize the undergraduate curriculum; and dr. rebecca hallman martini received a diversity research and scholarship grant to support minority students in uga’s writing center. dr. sara steger—and her team in the first-year writing program—was awarded a learning technologies grant for the on-going project to develop an online writing environment to support learning and writing instruction. additionally, dr. lindsey harding, dr. elizabeth davis, and dr. holly gallagher, with the support of multiple campus offices, including the center for teaching and learning and the division of academic enhancement, coordinated the programming of write@uga, which supports writing across the curriculum. this year, they focused on the theme of “writing for a better world,” and hosted in-person or virtual speakers to address writing pedagogy the creative writing program also supported student writers by hosting a “2 students + 2 alumni: a creative writing program reading” event, as well as poetry readings by contributors to stillpoint (the literary magazine featuring student writers and endowed by emeritus university professor and senior associate dean dr. hugh ruppersburg and tricia ruppersburg). as well, the department of english is committed to scholarship and research in our collective fields of inquiry. our newsletter showcases a number of such accomplishments, as demonstrated by conference participation, publications, and awards. two awards of note: dr. andrew zawacki received the prestigious distinguished research professorship, which acknowledges internationally recognized scholars for their creative and original impact in their fields, and dr. barbara mccaskill, with dr. nicholas allen and dr. valerie babb, received a million-dollar grant from the andrew w. mellon foundation for the project: \"culture and community at the penn center national historic landmark.” in the newsletter that follows, you’ll also find much to celebrate in the accomplishments of current students, this year’s graduates, and our alumni. with every best wish, dr. michelle ballif head of the department of english"
"unknown","hello all, i'll begin with sincere congratulations to the class of 2022, inclusive of our undergraduates and graduate students, all of whom have achieved their bas, mas, and phds, under the most grueling of circumstances. to risk hyperbole, completing a degree is always a n achievement but to do so during a historical event such as the global pandemic is little short of heroic. but we all deserve congratulations for finishing this year, a year that saw us returning to the classroom in greater numbers as we returned to \"normal,\" whatever that means. in some ways it was a return to what was, i see more students in my classroom, and sitting on the stone wall outside of park hall, reading and chatting, or simply sitting with their eyes d. but we've all changed over the past two years. for me, the trick is to keep moving forward with belief in what awaits. \"'hope is a thing with feathers --,\" emily dickinson reminds us, \"that perches in the soul -- / and sings the tune without the words -- / and never stops – at all – \". i'm writing this in late april, and the intense green of new leaves outside my office promises that spring is about to turn into summer, and thus the end of the academic year. we all long for those final weeks of the semester when april becomes may. in academia, there are two temporal cycles, the one that nature offers us and the other set forth by the academic calendar. those who are graduating are eager to begin the next phase of their lives, while continuing undergraduates and graduate students are already thinking about their fall schedules and responsibilities, even if they are also planning to sit in the sun and just breathe for at least a few of the hot summer days already promised in the air. faculty do the same, already putting together fall courses while figuring out ways to get their research done during those same humid hours. and, as always, some faculty are about to return to the temporal pattern that depends only on nature's seasons and not uga's. fall of 2022 saw the retirement of dr. tricia lootens, while dr. michelle ballif, our current department head, will be retiring in august. it has been my great pleasure to work with both of these distinguished and dedicated colleagues for more than 27 years, and the department will not be the same without them, at least not for me. but i'm a romanticist and an idealist and so i'll turn just slightly away from bittersweet goodbyes and the new rhythms they bring, borrowing my final words from philip larkin's \"the trees\". to all of you, i say \"begin afresh, afresh, afresh.\""

"unknown","well, that was a whirlwind! my first semester as interim head is now in the books, and i could not be more grateful for the experience. it has been a pleasure overseeing and supporting the incredible work of our students, faculty, and staff. if there is one thing i’ve learned so far, it is that the department of english is not discrete courses, programs, or projects. rather, it is a collective endeavor, an ever-evolving community of students, teachers, researchers, staff, and administrators, all of whom—without exception--are passionately dedicated to the study of language and writing. this semester brought a variety of changes. instead of spending endless hours on zoom, park hall is once again a busy and bustling place. (thank goodness.) this fall, we welcomed three terrific new faculty members: joshua cohen, david diamond, and david ingle. they are already contributing to the department in numerous ways and we feel fortunate to have them as colleagues. we also have many new students, new courses, and new opportunities for intellectual and social engagement. some of these new additions to the department are highlighted in this issue, which features lindsey harding’s digital storytelling showcase, caroline young’s time out of joint team, and nathan kreuter’s graduate seminar on rhetoric. at the same time, we must say a bittersweet farewell to some of the most treasured members of the department. tricia lootens, michelle ballif, and barbara bendzunas have all retired. tricia lootens, a widely respected scholar and teacher of victorian literature, retired in 2022 after teaching at uga for 29 years. michelle ballif, an eminent scholar of rhetoric and skilled administrator, came to uga in 1995 and served as the department head from 2016-22. during their time here, drs. lootens and ballif inspired countless students and had an indelible impact on their fields, the department, and the university. barbara bendzunas, until her retirement this winter, managed our main office. for the past 11 years, she did everything for the department from making copies to sharing fresh treats and vegetables. all of us will miss tricia, michelle, and barbara, and we wish them a happy and fulfilling retirement. as you will see in the pages of this newsletter, the department of english is a thriving intellectual community, and that is because of the work we do together both in and out of the classroom. so to everyone who has contributed to the department of english in one way or another, whether now or in the past: thank you so much."
"unknown","spring 2023 was a lively and productive semester for the department of english. successful classes were taught, work was published, prizes were won, and connections were made both on and off the page. this semester, we said goodbye to one of our most treasured staff members, eliana heckman, and we welcomed two new members to the team, peyton bailey and katelyn baase. we hosted our first departmental graduation since 2019, and were lucky enough to have dr. meg amstutz, dean of the jere w. morehead honors college, deliver the commencement speech to our graduating seniors. in addition, we hired a new department head, dr. roland végső. dr. végső is excited to come to georgia and brings a wealth of experience to the position. he currently serves as professor of english with a courtesy appointment in the department of communication studies at the university of nebraska-lincoln. until 2022, dr. végső served as vice chair of the department of english at the university of nebraska-lincoln. the future looks very bright for english at uga. although many things are new in the department, the most important things are very much the same. park hall is still a bustling place of intellectual community where everyone, it seems, is reading something. classes continue to be student-centered and focus on the complexities of language, storytelling, and verbal art. and english courses continue to be a terrific opportunity for students to truly develop and hone their writing skills, as we see in the feature about josh king’s innovative recent class. at the same time, we must say farewell to two of our most beloved faculty members, dr. john w. lowe and dr. jed rasula, both of whom have decided to retire. since his appointment in 2012 as the barbara methvin professor of southern literature, dr. lowe has been an invaluable and affable member of the department, teaching numerous classes—and publishing landmark scholarship--on southern literature and culture. he plans to stay in athens and finish up his much-anticipated authorized biography of ernest j. gaines. dr. rasula, since his appointment in 2001 as the helen s. lanier distinguished professor of english, has transformed the study of modernism and produced a bounty of influential scholarship. as the department head from 2014 to 2017, dr. rasula strengthened the department in multiple ways, boosting our research, updating the curriculum, and carrying out strategic long-term planning. he and suzi plan to move to la to be r to their family. i know i speak for all of you when i say: we will dearly miss dr. lowe and dr. rasula, and we are grateful for their many contributions to the department of english, the university of georgia, and the athens community."
"unknown","dear colleagues, students, alumni, and friends of english, i am writing to you for the first time as the new head of the department of english at the university of georgia. my journey to park hall has been long and somewhat adventurous. i am a native of hungary, and i completed most of my education in europe (in hungary and germany). after leaving europe behind, i earned my doctoral degree in english from suny/buffalo in western new york. my first job after graduation was at the university of tennessee, knoxville. in 2009, i moved to the university of nebraska-lincoln, where i taught for the last fourteen years. it was at unl that i moved through the ranks and was eventually promoted to full professor. during this time, i served for several years as the graduate chair, vice chair, and the acting chair of the department of english—a series of experiences that helped instill in me a sense of the importance of administrative service. needless to say, it was an inexhaustible fascination with language that set me on this career path. my current research primarily focuses on the first half of the 20th century and is located at the crossroads of literary criticism and philosophy. i am also deeply interested in the study and practice of translation, so i am always on the lookout for my next translation project. as i was preparing to move our family from nebraska to georgia over the summer, i was eagerly looking forward to joining what appeared to be a vibrant creative and intellectual community of students and faculty. i am happy to report that my first semester in park hall did not disappoint. as you will see in the rest of this newsletter, even in this short period of time our students, graduate students, and faculty members have accomplished a lot. several of them received awards, honors, and other recognitions for the outstanding work that they have been doing on or off campus. our faculty’s research has received national recognitions; our instructors received teaching awards; and we continue to do essential service to the people of georgia in a number of different ways. in light of this auspicious start in my new position, i find it easy to be optimistic about what we can accomplish together as a department. i am very much looking forward to working with my colleagues both in english and beyond to build an even brighter future. however, i was not the only new person who joined the department this last fall. we are very lucky to welcome several new colleagues. dr. julia rice mattison is our new medievalist and early modernist with a particular interest in material culture, multilingualism, translation. at the same time, we also hired another medievalist, dr. james sargan, who specializes in paleography, codicology, and the history of the book. although not new to park hall, dr. rodrigo martini paula has joined us as an assistant professor specializing in anglophone modernism, media studies, and animal studies. laura s. mckee is our new coordinator of writing across the curriculum program and works with the writing intensive program and the writing center to manage curricular initiatives primarily focused on enhancing stem and interdisciplinary writing. finally, we hired jami mays as our new front office assistant who also provides support to the creative writing program. those of you who are still in park hall will certainly have a chance to meet her in our front office on the second floor. at the same time, we also had to say goodbye to dr. roxanne eberle, who decided to retire at the end of the fall semester. beyond her contributions to the field of british nineteenth-century studies, dr. eberle has had a striking impact on the life of the department. as chair of the british women writers association, she brought the group’s conference to athens twice. she took on a variety of important administrative positions in the department—including undergraduate coordinator and associate head—for more than a decade in total. and as a co-director of uga’s colloquium in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature since 2011, she helped to bring an impressive roster of scholars to campus, where they interacted ly with both faculty and students. a recipient of multiple teaching awards, roxanne has also been a treasured mentor to several generations of our graduate students."

"unknown","dear colleagues, students, alumni, and friends of english, another year has passed, and the department of english continues to be the source of exciting new work in all the fields of our discipline that our faculty and students are involved with. it would take too long to list all of our recent accomplishments, so i will mention here only some of our highlights from 2024. david diamond published his first scholarly monograph, reading character after calvin: secularization, empire, and the 18th-century novel. esra mirze santesso received an honorable mention in the competition for the modern language association’s 2024 scaglione prize for middle eastern studies for her book muslim comics and warscape witnessing . ed pavlić’s essay “anita baker introduced us...” was selected for inclusion in the best american essays 2024 anthology. leanne howe received the 2024 arrell gibson lifetime achievement award from the oklahoma center for the book board of directors. aruni kashyap published his collection of stories, the way you want to be loved, and received a prestigious fellowship from the radcliffe institute for advanced study at harvard university. chigozie obioma published his third novel, the road to the country, and was honored by new africa magazine in its list of the 100 most influential africans of 2024. rebecca hallman martini, the director of the willis center for writing, won the 2024 conference on college composition and communication’s advancement of knowledge award for her book disrupting the center: a partnership approach to writing across the university . speaking of the writing center, the fall semester of 2024 marked a major milestone in the history of this facility. with a generous donation from jill and marvin willis as well as vital support from president jere w. morehead, the jill and marvin willis center of writing officially opened its doors in its new central location in the miller learning center. we held a festive opening ceremony on august 28, 2024, where president morehead and dean anna stenport were among our invited speakers. under rebecca hallman martini’s excellent leadership, the willis center for writing continues to offer support to all students, faculty, and staff on a wide variety of writing-related projects. their services are free of cost and available to all uga writers. many of our students also had a truly successful year. rahad abir was named the georgia author of the year in the literary fiction and short story collection category for his book bengal hound . jessica demarco-jacobson’s article, “the risorgimento of christina rossetti” was published in the 2024 special edition of the pre-raphaelite society review . abhijit sarmah was a finalist for the prestigious ruth lilly and dorothy sargent rosenberg poetry fellowship for the second consecutive year. saurabh anand received a short-term research grant from the german academic exchange service (daad) as well as the scholar of dream award from the conference on college composition and communication. you can read more about their accomplishments in the rest of the newsletter. but i hope that even this selective list clearly demonstrates how lucky we are to be able to work with so many exceptionally talented writers and thinkers in the english department. as some of you might recall, the fall semester of 2023 started with some unexpected news. in early august, we learned that our recently retired colleague, john wharton lowe, passed away. professor lowe was barbara methvin professor of english specializing in southern and multiethnic literatures. he has authored and edited numerous books, published dozens of essays, and presented over 80 papers in north america, europe, and asia. we are now delighted to announce that with a generous gift from june c. lowe, professor lowe’s widow, we will be able to launch the john wharton lowe graduate fellowship and the john wharton lowe graduate support fund. both the fellowship and the support fund are designed to provide support to graduate students who work in the fields that were important for professor lowe during his distinguished career. if you are yourself an enthusiast of southern and multiethnic literatures or if you have been lucky enough to personally benefit from professor’s lowe’s infinite spirit of generosity, please consider donating to the john wharton lowe, iii doctoral fellowship in american, southern american or multicultural american or to the john wharton lowe, iii doctoral support fund at these links. this year, we have also established the dr. chris alexander first year writing support fund to honor the memory of our recently deceased colleague. dr. alexander earned his phd in english rhetoric and composition from the university of louisville in 2010 and joined our department as a lecturer in 2011. among other things, he frequently taught courses in technical and professional communication. the fund will provide support for the first - year writing program within the department of english where dr. alexander taught most of his courses. if you consider writing in all its forms to be an essential skill, you can help our students by donating to this fund. 2024 was also a watershed year for one of our other distinguished colleagues. after an illustrious career of dedicated service, dr. kretzschmar, a world-renowned linguist, who has been a cornerstone of uga’s department of english, making groundbreaking contributions to sociolinguistics and dialectology, particularly through his work on the linguistic atlas project, decided to retire. throughout his tenure, dr. kretzschmar inspired countless students across several continents and enriched the university’s academic community with his expertise and passion. his contributions have left an indelible mark on uga and the field of linguistics. i will conclude this note by wishing a happy new year to everyone. i want to thank you all for your continued support of our department. i am looking forward to all the new projects that we will be able to work on together during the forthcoming year."

"unknown","dr. mary anne o’neal of athens, georgia died on june 17, 2023 after living with appendix cancer for over 10 years. born in bennettsville, south carolina on may 17, 1963, she was a graduate of marlboro academy (sc), earned her b.a. in english at mars hill college in 1985, her m.a. ed. from western carolina university in 1988, and her ph.d. in english from the university of georgia in 1999. she taught english at uga for three decades and was beloved by generations of her students. she was an accomplished scholar and teacher and a skilled pianist whose varied repertoire ranged from chopin to broadway show tunes to top 40 hits of the 1970s and 1980s to the broadman hymnal. she created a beautiful garden at her home in athens that continues to be a place of peace and comfort for her family and friends (though in her charming, self-deprecating way she once wrote in a poem that she had “failed to ferret out the green verbena in its youth”). she loved words and books and wrote a brilliant dissertation on kate chopin and other women writers of new orleans. travel was her all-consuming passion, and over many years she and her family took trips to the united kingdom, ireland, france, germany, austria, italy, portugal, the netherlands, and spain, as well as to new orleans, santa fe, oregon, california, and many other places in the united states. in all things, mary anne embraced the beauty and magic she found in the everyday. “i’ve decided that the universe is going to come to me,” she once said, “if i can’t go to the universe.” she lived her entire life to the fullest, but particularly so in the years since her diagnosis. she traveled widely, befriended many, and fiercly and fully loved fully her husband of 25 years, dr. david ingle, and their three children joseph (and his wife victoria), madeleine, and eliza. mary anne had a rare combination of fine qualities: a brilliant mind, a formidable memory, a gentle spirit, effortless beauty, and an ease about herself that in turn put those around her at ease. she possessed resilience, wit, wisdom, grace, and genuine compassion. she was eminently practical yet admirably idealistic. words cannot capture her adequately, but one of her dear friends put it well when she said, “when i was with her, i knew i was home.” in addition to her husband and children, she is survived by her father, charles o’neal of brownsville, south carolina (her mother, celia moore o’neal, predeceased her in 2011), her sister martha glover (husband will, niece celia adams, nephews bill and tom glover), and her brothers charlie (marsha, bo, and erin), steve (ann, jennifer and scott), and johnny (beverly, jessica, joshua, and jacob). after her death, her daughter madeleine discovered the following quote from john henry griffith in mary anne’s notes. we think its eloquence should be shared: “i am convinced that there is something more: that human consciousness is independent of the body and that the death of the body is not an ending of consciousness -- it is rather a passing. into what? i confess i do not know, but i have a deep, abiding trust in the divine ground of all existence that the major world religions have variously called god, mind, allah, tao, etc. my parting wish for my friends is that they nurture compassion and walk humbly in the presence of unfathomable mystery.”"
"unknown","on august 24th, the creative writing program invited our communities to gather in park hall, formally welcome, and celebrate three new phd students: o-jeemiah agbaakin, erik b. brown, and colin bishoff. free and open to the public, this year’s inaugural reading drew an exciting and engaged crowd to the park hall auditorium. celebrants, authors, and mentors enjoyed a catering spread and fellowship with one another after the summer holidays before taking their seats. first, the audience enjoyed a gripping cluster of poetry from o-jeemiah agbaakin. up next, erik b. brown treated the group to some of his own captivating verse. finally, colin bishoff pivoted to prose and delighted the crowd with selections from one of his short stories. this event displayed the incredible range of talents in our cwp program and indicated an inspiring year to come. in october, the georgia colloquium in eighteenth and nineteenth-century british literature hosted dr. nasser mufti (university of illinois-chicago), a highly regarded expert on the intersections between nineteenth-century british literature and postcolonial studies. dr. mufti gave a fascinating and well-attended talk on “the victorians at decolonization,” which was followed by a lively reception. the colloquium in eighteenth and nineteenth-century british literature is co-directed by david diamond and casie legette, and supported by the willson center and the rodney baine lecture fund. the uga chapter of sigma tau delta , the national english honors society, welcomed twelve new members at its annual induction ceremony on thursday, november 9th at 5 p.m. in the park hall library. sigma tau delta is dedicated to creating community within the english department by organizing volunteer opportunities and holding formal and informal get-togethers throughout the school year. the newest class of members includes: ava allred, whitney bramlett, katherine burch, cacie cummings, kate gottsman, jason hawkins, nico houser, audrey kirkland, anna sears, shelby williams, and autumn rose young. sigma tau delta president kai spencer and treasurer brienne heinssen also graduated in december 2023. we thank them for their leadership and service and know they will continue to do great things! an unhinged powerpoint night. a halloween costume party. a poetry reading in the style of dead poets society. study halls where studying is definitely done. a craft party where fall leaves are transformed into art by gentle hands. at the undergraduate english association , all of these nights of whimsy are possible. “last spring, we still felt like we were figuring out what we wanted this club to be,” says nina meier, the uea’s president. “this semester was all about building up that foundation.” core philosophies were kept, such as the need to build a community within park hall, but now that the uea was established there was room to experiment with events and activities. some weeks were planned meticulously in advance, such as the uea’s discussion with time out of joint, an organization that does shakespeare workshops in prisons. members were able to ask formerly incarcerated educators questions about their mission to make shakespeare accessible and their individual pedagogies. other weeks had more room for spontaneity, such as the fall crafts meeting. outside of park hall library, the uea goes to rook and pawn in downtown athens the first friday of every month, for hours of elevated tomfoolery. now wrapping up its second semester since its (re?)founding, the undergraduate english association has come into its own. they have regular speakers, such as dr. lasek-white, who gave an in-depth presentation about career preparation and professionalization. the board ensured that most weeks had activities that promote socialization and new connections between english majors. the integration of freshmen into the club was of particular concern, as many senior members remembered what it had been like to be a freshman english major, still isolated from the department and having few, if any, friends within it. the club’s president, nina meier, graduated this fall (go nina!!) and her absence will be felt and suffered. nina’s efforts to coordinate events, connect with club members, and her general effervescent personality will be sorely missed. but the club is in the capable hands of dani garcia-pozo, the current vice president. next semester, dani plans to continue nina’s legacy by doing more fun events, expanding the outreach of the club, and endeavoring to make the uea’s meetings something that all english majors look forward to attending. the ongoing uga symposium on the book (co-curated by profs. miriam jacobson, sujata iyengar, and librarian anne meyers devine) held two meetings this year. the first, featuring professor kim coles (university of maryland), formed part of the year-long phillis wheatley peters project run by drs. barbara mccaskill, sarah ruffing robbins (tcu) and mona narain (tcu) and comprised a keynote by dr. coles, \"the blood of christians: phillis wheatley peters and white christianity\" that offered a new reading of coles' famous poem \"on being brought from africa to america\" and a workshop with coles and dr. david diamond (uga), on early printed books in the uga special collections libraries, including our first edition of wheatley peters' poems (1773). sponsors included the willson center, the department of english, and the bibliographical society of america. our second meeting, \"unbinding book history,\" unspooled over two days of events in early september 2023 that explored the intricate connections among literature, book arts, and history. the symposium, sponsored by the willson center, departments of english and romance languages, the office of institutional diversity, the institutes for african american studies and for women's studies, and the bibliographical society of america, featured a keynote address by acclaimed artist suzanne coley and a panel with special guest professor jennifer low (florida atlantic university), an early modern scholar and apprentice book artist. coley's presentation intricately wove together historical african, american, and african american textiles, investigating gender, race, and memory through exquisitely sewn, embroidered, and printed books. the symposium also included two faculty panels, one with drs. james sargan, julie mattison, and jacobson, and another with drs. iyengar and nora benedict with featured invited speaker professor jennifer low. drs. sargan, mattison, and jacobson shared scholarship on new ways to read medieval and renaissance book bindings through queer and trans theory, attention to fragments, and historical fantasies about binding. drs. iyengar and low responded to coley's work by analyzing the relationship between shakespeare and contemporary book arts; dr. benedict considered artists' books from contemporary latin america. the symposium concluded with a masterclass with cynthia camp on a unique book of hours held by uga's special collections libraries that examined one part of the book, the calendar, for idiosyncratic local saints. collectively, these events blended creative practice with scholarly expertise, contemporary and theoretical approaches with historical perspectives, and cross-disciplinary conversations with hands-on learning."

"unknown","anna forrester earned her phd in may 2021. she is now the assistant editor at the new georgia encyclopedia (nge), the nation’s first born-digital state encyclopedia. in truth i became an english major more so out of necessity than by choice. at the university of tennessee, my major was studio art until my junior year, when some nerve-related issues led me to lose partial control of my dominant hand, and i could no longer draw to fulfill my coursework. i changed my major to english because i adored the shakespeare survey i was taking, and my professor was a huge advocate of my shifting needs and permitted me to incorporate creativity into my assignments. this isn’t a journey i often share, but it’s the one that happened, and i don’t wish it otherwise. i went on to fall in love with early modern literature, and after graduate school i’ve since found my way back to a creative world, too. i also now work in illustration, which feels both like a happy return and an extension of my academic background: i love working in monoline aesthetics, derivative of early modern woodcuts, and densely stylized maps, characteristic of seventeenth-century cartography. picking just one is exceptionally difficult! a simple moment that was formative early on in my graduate study was an exchange with our beloved dr. d. her “shakespeare, media, and appropriation” class was my very first seminar, and in the first week we had what felt like a month’s worth of reading compared to what i was accustomed to as an undergraduate. i devoured it! i remember feeling totally on fire yet totally overwhelmed. those feelings must have registered plainly on my face in that second week of class, because dr. d said “forrester, you look totally lost. did you know that’s the best place to be?”. i didn’t know it at the time, but dr. d was telling we that there was a great intellectual worth in curiosity, uncertainty; to be lost was to ever be in a place to find. that exchange stuck with me as a motivator for finding my footing whenever i felt stuck in my work during my doctoral study. what feels most significant among all the lessons i learned from my english major is the skill of writing. writing skills so often decide crucial opportunities for us, whether that be jobs, fellowships, graduate schools, or other markers of professionalization. for me, i was trained and encouraged by one professor in particular to study grant writing, cover letter writing, and writing for general audiences. that training led me to secure fellowships, awards, some financial security, and even creative opportunities later in my life that i wouldn’t have had otherwise. writing is a skill that never ceases to be asked of us, whether that be in workspaces, social media spaces, or basic spaces of communication. and i think (and hope) english majors are better able to leverage that skill to see through some pretty cool opportunities. rebecca makkai’s the great believers (2018) has stuck with me as the most memorable read of my adult life. the book unfolds around a queer community in chicago during the aids crisis and explores how that tragedy shapes their lives as they search for meaning, goodness, resolution, and joy in its aftermath. it ticked my boxes. i recently finished tomorrow, tomorrow, and tomorrow (2022) by gabrielle zevin at the advice of a very trusted avid worker. i am not and have never been a gamer, but there was and is a major appeal to me in the world-building side of playing games that, also as a creative, i am totally enthralled by (that and of course the macbeth reference in the title!). jennifer martin graduated from uga with a master's in english in 2011. currently, she serves as an english instructor in a title 1 high school - peach county high. she teaches american literature, advanced placement, american sign language, and journalism. jennifer has been recognized as star teacher 2020, donors choose recipient, \"my teachers is tops\" on channel 13, and is a bright ideas funding recipient. her short story \"the notes between shalom\" was recently published by syncopation literary journal. when i was in ninth grade, my high school gifted english teacher--thomas d. orr--taught true critical thinking with the literature we read. i encountered characters and questions that i never would have previously considered. i fell in love with the possibilities and escapes that reading can provide. dr. reg mcknight treated me more like family than as a mere student. all these years later, i still attribute much of my success to dr. mcknight; to say he was both supportive and inspirational would be an understatement. through my own professors, i learned different styles of teaching. i also learned american sign language at uga with judi oliver; i now teach that as well. my favorite book is bastard out of carolina by dorothy allison. i just finished educated by tara westover. it is riveting and shows that nonfiction reading is not just boring history and facts. it also provides inspiration for teachers and lessons for parents."

of the print artifact. especially interesting is the introduction of illustrative quotations into the essay from a variety of literary sources – most notably from jonathan swift’s a tale of tub first

"unknown","as the new front office and creative writing assistant, jami mays wears a lot of hats. managing the mail, stocking office supplies, and scanning entire manuscripts is just a fraction of her duties; she also aids the creative writing department by organizing events with authors and lecturers, and provides planning, logistical, and creative support. “i plan to die in this office,” she jokes, after discussing the joy the position has brought her. prior to this job, jami worked with a local athens labor advocacy and workers justice non-profit. though she valued the work and felt passionate about the difference she was making in the community, the labor it demanded of her was unsustainable. it was difficult to find the separation she needed between her work and personal life. after covid, during which she worked advocating for teachers that were similarly burnt out, she felt she needed a change and applied for a open positions at uga. here, she felt she could find a stable environment and continue her education. having pursued education entirely for the purpose of employment before, jami saw an opportunity to continue her education here at uga, and finally focus on where her passions lie. “i’m not sure exactly what that will be, but i’m excited to find out.” she mentions art and english and potential contenders, but also says that she wants to take time to explore her interests and truly experience the joy of learning for the sake of learning. in her free time, jami can be found crocheting with a steaming mug of cacao. her office already boasts items she’s made: a pencil crocheted from rope and a basket. in the future, she wants to learn how to make clothes. jami also enjoys writing, specifically narrative non-fiction. years ago, she helped produce a creative writing show in atlanta, write club. it’s well known as the world’s largest “combative philanthropic literary bloodsport,” wherein writers compete to compose and present a piece about two very different ideas for charity. “i really enjoyed the freedom and collaboration of that environment,” she says. additionally, jami likes to spend time with her family; her husband is the executive chef at mama’s boy, and she has two children, one 21 and one eight. “he’s at the age where he still loves me,” she jokes about her younger son, who she enjoys quality time with when she volunteers at his elementary school. finally, if jami had to show aliens anything from earth, she would show them the ongoing lifespan of the internet, from its genesis in the 90s to the present. to provide them with an understanding of humanity, she would show them napster, aol, aim, and myspace; the complete journey from there to now. “it’s the most accessible and connected thread for the last 20-30 years for how humanity has progressed. everything - pop culture, music, history - it’s all interwoven.” i can think of some things i wouldn’t want aliens to see on the internet, but jami seems to be a glass half full person. hopefully the aliens won’t decide to smite us after seeing all the internet has to offer."

"unknown","dr. mattison’s office is south-facing, so the mid-morning sun illuminates the medieval posters on the walls and the books on the shelves. it’s a welcoming space -- there’s even a wire basket of snacks by her desk. despite the homey style of her office, dr. mattison hasn’t called georgia home for long. she received her b.a. at yale university in french and english, but then crossed the atlantic for her masters at oxford university. finally, she returned to north america to complete her phd at toronto university. since her undergraduate career, dr. mattison has been drawn to medieval studies. at yale, she took a course titled “the age of cathedrals in paris,” and from that point onward she knew her career would involve the intersections of history, manuscripts, and language. while studying at oxford, dr. mattison was able to access many more primary sources, such as medieval books, documents, manuscripts, and buildings, that led her to view books and languages as reflections of medieval culture and society. by studying medieval texts and how language functions within them, she hopes to open new windows for analyzing the past. in one example of her research, dr. mattison discusses an old, popular arthurian legend. it was spread through england, but instead of being written in old english, it was written in french. she grows animated as she talks about the linguistic impacts of the norman conquest, which transformed upper-levels of english society into a multilingual aristocracy. it is this type of syncretism of languages, literatures, and cultures that is so fascinating to dr. mattison. however, this intersection is under-researched, as people from both sides of study - english and french - are unsure where, exactly, the literature falls under. luckily, dr. mattison cares little for categories, and far more about the important conclusions that might be drawn from a more interdisciplinary study of these types of literature and language. the physical study of manuscripts is also a passion of dr. mattison’s. between old, decaying pages, many treasures can be found. for example, a flower, pressed between lines of latin, aged and forgotten. “it’s interesting to think about how something that for them was an everyday object has become such a valuable source to us,” she says. or a cat’s footprint as they walked over fresh ink while stalking mice. there are less romantic things, like dirt, or even book curses -- violent poems directing misfortune and injury at book thieves. what wonderful continuity; hundreds of years ago people treasured their books just as much as they do today. dr. mattison is just as cool outside of her office as she is in it. first off, she was wearing a sweater that she had knitted herself when i interviewed her -- you can’t get cooler than that. she also enjoys cooking, and doesn’t limit herself to one culture either. “it depends on what i have access to,” she says, meaning that in the netherlands, where she was an assistant professor, her style was largely european, but now that she’s back in the states she can cook a richer variety. in contrast to the serenity dr. mattison says cooking brings her, she seeks the adrenaline provided by top-roping, a style of rock climbing. “it’s very stress relieving,” she says sarcastically, “to be twenty, thirty feet off the ground.” to relax from that harrowing experience, dr. mattison enjoys watching bad reality tv, reading all of jane austen (especially emma ), and listening to boygenius. to wrap up the interview, i ask dr. mattison a question i’ve been thinking about: if she could show something created by humanity to an alien society, what would it be? she takes a moment to think, then says, “notre dame.” beyond its architectural and historical significance, the building itself is representative of 19th century medievalism, which has its roots in “colonialism, nostalgia, and nationalism.” these issues bleed into the value placed today on “white, western, christian art” over non-western art, as seen with reactions to the 2019 fire at notre dame versus the lack of sympathy for other losses of cultural heritage. “for me, notre dame is as much an idea of the past as part of the actual past.” to show aliens notre dame is to show them the refracted rainbow of humanity: the dreams, the losses, and the bones the present is built upon."
"unknown","after eleven years teaching in the english department, dr. john lowe is retiring from the university of georgia in may 2023. when the english department began seeking applicants for a position in southern literature in 2012, dr. lowe didn’t initially send in an application. instead, the english department sought him for the position. at the time, he was teaching at louisiana state university, where his work focused on african american literature and multi-ethnic southern literature. he candidly admits that he loved teaching at lsu and “louisiana culture,” and he “really didn’t think [he’d] take the job” even after uga requested his application and ultimately offered him the position. still hesitant, he was invited for a campus visit and was immediately impressed with the university and its support for faculty research. although his decision to accept the position was partially influenced by how his mother lived to campus, what really won him over was the “magnificent” main library. his love for football also influenced his decision, and he is proud to have witnessed two championship wins during his time at uga, confessing that “[he] loves the dawgs and the traditions of the game.” originally from atlanta, dr. lowe received his b.a. in english from vanderbilt, but he had no intentions of becoming an english professor. instead, he went to law school at emory university, but he was only able to complete one year of the program before being drafted into the army. after serving in the army, he worked as a financial analyst at donne and bradstreet in atlanta, but he quickly became “restless” there. his wife persuaded him to attend graduate school under the gi bill, and he attended georgia state “because [he] couldn’t afford emory” at the time. he was then accepted into columbia university, where he earned his phd in comparative literature. initially, his dissertation focused on “faulkner, melville, and the bible,” but when traveling to spain with his wife, “all [his] melville books were stolen with [their] luggage.” because he needed to finish his dissertation to begin his post at st. mary’s college in notre dame, he “dropped melville, and [st. mary’s] never knew that.” he taught at st. mary’s for four years before receiving a mellon appointment at harvard in african american studies. he decided to re-enter the job market now that his recommendation letters were all written on harvard stationary. out of over fourteen interviews, he accepted a position at lsu, and “[he] never thought [he’d] leave” until uga “came calling.” while he “knew there was a job” in southern literature open at uga, he “wasn’t interested,” but that quickly changed. he has now been teaching southern literature at the university of georgia since 2012. although he was initially “torn” between lsu and uga, he says, “[coming to uga] was a good decision, and i’ve been happy here. i love the students…[and the] opportunities here to develop new courses…and so much support for my travels.” within those eleven years, dr. lowe has earned an esteemed reputation in southern literature and african american studies. although he is known for his work in southern literature, he has cast his net much more widely, working in multi-ethnic southern literature that includes african american, native american, italian american, asian american, and caribbean literature. as he remarked, when it comes to southern literature, “you name it,” and he’s done it. he sets apart a few defining moments within his career. at lsu, he directed their summer program in italy for six years, and even now, his office is decorated with photographs of the classes he took to italy. he received a fulbright in munich and was one of the founders of african american studies at lsu. he is “proudest” of the conference he organized for melus (multi-ethnic literature of the united states) in 2015 at uga. he remembers “lovely” receptions, brilliant keynote speakers, and christina garcia speaking to a “full house” at the uga chapel. he recalls how the event “pulled people from the [english] department together” and “introduced them to a lot of people [he] cared about in melus.” his “real love in literature,” though, remains african american literature, and his fondest moments of his career involve teaching courses on the harlem renaissance, black writers in the south, and black women writers. that love was one of his deciding factors for accepting a position at uga: “one of the reasons i came here is that my real love in literature is african american literature, and when i first came here, we had a really great representation in the department.” while he has published numerous titles, dr. lowe pinpoints calypso magnolia: the crosscurrents of caribbean and southern literature as the “big book” of his career, and the most personally significant writing project is the biography of ernest j. gaines that he has been writing for ten years. his newest book, black hibiscus: african americans and the florida imaginary , will be published soon, and he is currently editing a book on colson whitehead. with numerous book projects still in the works, dr. lowe “is still busy” as his retirement approaches, and he plans to keep it that way. realizing that he is “really an office person” and “can’t work at home,” his first goal in retirement is “try to develop the ability to work at home,” but his main priority is to “keep doing [his] books and…going to conferences.” his retirement will not be all work, however. he wants to start working out with his wife through silver sneakers, play racquet ball with a longtime friend from louisiana, and play the piano more “seriously.” he is a “serious cook” and plans on hosting more dinner parties while learning spanish through lacsi (latin american caribbean studies institute). he is travelling to france in september for a southern literature conference. out of his retirement plans, he is “most looking forward to finishing [the] biography [of ernest gaines]”: “it’s really a burden for me…it’s the first one, and he asked me to write it. i have a solemn promise to him. he died in 2019…i’m writing it for him. i’m not writing it for me. i want his reputation to be larger than it is now and have more people reading him.” as dr. lowe prepares for retirement, he looks back on his career while looking forward to the legacies that he wants to leave. he hopes that his teaching has left students not only with the “skills to better understand the value of literature,” but also the skills “to make them better citizens.” he believes that “literature often gives you guideposts for life,” which helps students become better (literary) citizens in the world through what they read. he is “proud of [his] legacy with graduate students,” having directed twenty-nine dissertations throughout his career. for him, his biggest legacy lies in his work with african american ph.d. students at lsu. he keeps pictures of those students in his office, noting that “they’ve all gone on to be great teachers and administrators all over the country.” he sees those students as “carrying on the work [he’s] done. they’re kind of like [his] children in a way.” he also points to publications on zora neale hurston and ernest gaines as a “big legacy because [they]…weren’t appreciated at one time.” dr. lowe, too, leaves behind a legacy of “lifelong friendship” with the faculty who have worked ly beside him in the english department. he is confident that his relationship with those friendships “will continue.” he and his wife have no intentions of leaving athens anytime soon. rather, he reassures us, “we’ll be here.” brianna phillips is an english ph.d. student and fyw instructor in the english department at uga."

"unknown","my books add up to over a million words. thankfully the number of book covers is more modest, and on the principle that a picture says more than a thousand words, i’m happy to have them make up a parade. looking back on the 15 titles i published between 1986 and 2022, the covers sort out into these categories. several were invented entirely by the publisher [ the american poetry wax museum , what the thunder said , the anthology burning city , and the poetry collections hot wax and hectic pigment ]. i didn’t like the cover of wax at all, but the book made my reputation, so i can’t complain. the others are fetching. but i now find the cover of my last book, what the thunder said , a tad busier than i’d like. i’ve been very lucky with designers who took an image i provided and really made it zing. [ this compost, syncopations, modernism and poetic inspiration, acrobatic modernism, genre and extravagance in the novel, and wreading ] i think they’re all stunning, though i’m especially fond of the color palette the university of georgia press found for this compost , and i love the way oxford set off the single lens surrealist eyeglass for acrobatic modernism. there are two covers i designed myself. my first book was a collection of poems and drawings, tabula rasula , which i did while working as a typesetter and graphic designer before my academic career. the other was history of a shiver . using an old photographic image from an obscure spanish photographer, i offered this to the humanities center at the university of oregon for a talk i was giving there. oxford then accepted it as a cover, but changed the typeface to a sans serif font. i preferred what i’d done for oregon, but the difference is negligible. the final category is a bit of each of the above. my history of dada, destruction was my beatrice , used an image of hugo ball performing at cabaret voltaire in zurich in 1916, and while i’d suggested the image i hadn’t provided it. but it’s iconic, and i love the color design on the black and white photo. imagining language was given a lavish treatment at mit press, and they contacted one of the contributors to the anthology, english artist tom phillips, who supplied new work for the cover. my favorite rendition is the treatment given the whole book by atlanta artist brian dettmer, who specializes in excavating the innards of books, working diligently with an exacto knife. he sought my permission to buy two rare copies of the out of print book to cut it up. one is now among my favorite possessions."

"unknown","this project began with a conversation between me and dr. sarah ruffing robbins, lorraine sherley professor of american literature at tcu. 2023 marks the 250th anniversary of the publication of phillis wheatley peters’ poems on various subjects, religious and moral (london, 1773), the first known book of poetry by a black woman in what would become the us. after speaking to national colleagues about this sesquicentennial, we learned that most did not have programs planned. our decision to organize just a few events between tcu and uga morphed into the year-long, eighteen-event program, “the genius of phillis wheatley peters: a poet and her legacies,” co-organized by dr. robbins and dr. mona narain, both of tcu, and me. spring and fall 2023 events have been virtual, in-person, or hybrid. they have attracted national and international attendees and participants, and funding from georgia humanities, humanities texas, and the willson center. one highlight was a panel discussion of materials in the american antiquarian society (aas), the largest repository of pre-twentieth century american literature, which included aas archivists who described how the humanities prepared them for their careers. a program hit was favored by the muses, a 1934 pageant about wheatley peters by the black educator and activist mary church terrell, which professor george contini (theatre and film) adapted for the stage. performing during spotlight on the arts, a cast of student and community members and student musicians participated, guided also by professor james weidman (jazz studies program/african american studies) and professor jason aryeh (dance/african american studies). so many english department faculty gave generously of their time and expertise as panelists or event organizers: david diamond, aruni kashyap, susan rosenbaum (interdisciplinary modernisms workshop), miriam jacobson and sujata iyengar (symposium on the book). emerita professor elizabeth kraft generously funded tina borah’s work on social media, and the late john lowe underwrote honoraria for a panel with biographer vincent carretta. our team is preparing an invited book proposal for an international university press. we also have a program or two in the works for 2024. stay tuned!"

"unknown","dr. coburn freer became a professor and head of the english department at the university of georgia in 1980. he led the department up until 1992. dr. freer was a well-loved member of the department whose research interests included 16th and 17th-century english literature. as department head, he introduced several new traditions, some academic. for example, he brought in scholars that he knew to give talks to the department and mingle with the students. some of the traditions were non-academic, like having picnics and canoeing at a lake. mrs. ramona freer, his wife, said dr. freer loved teaching and his students. \"he was a tough teacher […] and he really loved being in the department,\" mrs. freer said. \"he had wonderful colleagues, and they were very supportive.” outside of teaching, dr. freer loved watching american football (especially uga football!), bicycling, and his airedale terriers, all of which had shakespearean names. he also enjoyed travelling and working on cars. mrs. freer remembers when she and her husband were driving in germany, and dr. freer asked to stop at a house that had famous formula one race cars. her husband asked the guard if he could take a look at the car and the race track. the guard offered to let dr. freer take his vw bus on the famous race course. “it was just hilarious,” said mrs. freer. “and for him, that was the high part of the summer as far as i’m concerned.” dr. freer died of lewy body dementia in 2019. his wife ramona freer, and their daughters meg and elinor, wanted to establish a scholarship in his honor and keep his beloved memory alive. “my daughters thought it would be a good idea to have extra money available for graduate students,” said mrs. freer, “because undergraduates have a lot of opportunities for extra money, but not so much for graduate students.” mrs. freer explained her daughters struggled financially during the last few years of their phds. “they didn’t want to call mom and dad and ask for money,” said mrs. freer. “they insisted on doing it on their own, but it was hard [...] so i know what they’re [graduate students are] going through.” “it’d be nice to be able to help somebody, somebody who really needed the help,” continued mrs. freer. although his research interests focused on 16th and 17th-century english literature, dr. freer also loved modern poetry. his three favorite things to read were milton, shakespeare, and the bible. because of his various literary interests, dr. freer’s daughters did not want the scholarship to be limited to just those wanting to study in the elizabethan age. instead, it will be open to graduate students showing great interest in doing further research for whatever their specialty may be. the coburn freer family award was recently created for these purposes: it will provide financial aid to outstanding graduate students in the english department. but perhaps more importantly, it will allow us all to remember someone integral to the spirit of park hall. jessica demarco-jacobson is a master’s student in the english department at uga."

"unknown","the day is overcast yet warm, the way georgia is as it steps forward and back into spring. myself and a group of students follow dr. nancee reeves as her own personal entourage as she leads us to the special collections library, where she has arranged for the english undergraduate association to tour the archives. we meet several more members of the club inside the library, then curators paul and jill take us down to the archives. there, we experience a multitude of wonders: the pleasant cold that preserves the collections, an in-depth discussion of fire-precautions taken in the library, a look at football tickets from the 1929 commencement of sanford stadium, and a masterful demonstration of the forklift by paul. he hovers high above us, and at someone’s request, takes a photo of our club corralled into one of the archive’s narrowed corridors, as we grin in the cold. this is just one of the events that has been planned and executed by the newly resuscitated english undergraduate association. near the end of fall 2022, dr. reeves had asked the english majors within her utopian literature class if they would want to be involved in reviving the english undergraduate association, whose corpse had cooled in the ground after the last few rounds of graduates. many of us in the room immediately assented, having felt that there was a lack of undergraduate community within park hall. we knew of our fellow english majors, yet there was no single space for us to gather, united with purpose, beyond the classroom. to many, this was the chance to form a true community, where english undergraduate students could share resources, develop camaraderie, and plan their futures beyond the arch together. so when spring semester came, that same group of students reconvened, and broke ground on building the new english undergraduate association. they held an election, selecting a president, vice-president, and other essential board members, and made a list of goals for the semester. since then, they have hosted speakers, gathered for icebreakers beyond campus, toured the depths of the special collections library, and, most recently, hosted a poetry reading. one of the most important initiatives spearheaded by the undergraduate english association was opening a study hall within park hall. prior to this endeavor, many students felt park hall lacked community. “i was always self conscious just standing in the halls talking to people. there wasn’t really a space to gather,” says mann sy tha, a junior comparative literature and english major. many english majors felt disconnected from one another, simply because there was no space for them within park hall to connect with other english majors. that changed because of the efforts of the eua, especially their president, nina meier, a rising senior majoring in english. nina became the president of the eua “to create a greater community within park hall, specifically for english majors.” despite planning to graduate in the fall, nina felt like she didn’t know many english majors. “my goal for the uea is to give the english major that smaller school feel of community, as well as give people the opportunity to meet different professors, go to events, work creatively, and have outlets for their work.” most of all, she hopes that the uea will continue after she graduates. looking forward, the undergraduate english association hopes to expand its study hall hours, plan networking opportunities for english majors, and continue to offer a space for community and camaraderie within park hall. you can find them every tuesday in the english library in park hall at 4pm, likely engaging in spirited discussions about poetry, literature, or reciting prose on top of chairs, in true dead poets society fashion. jessica schumaker is an english major at uga and the social media intern for the english department."
"unknown","dr. joshua king has been playing and writing with video games since his doctoral days at the university of georgia. in the first year writing department, dr. king is known for his game-based writing courses that rely on video games and game design to “defamiliarize” students’ understandings of rhetorical choices and the “experiences” that texts offer. his initial interest in pairing writing/rhetoric with gaming began in a graduate course taught dr. iyengar in 2012. in that course, he designed a video game based on edmund spenser’s the faerie queen (1590), a project that radically changed how he experienced spenser’s text. his faerie queen game inspired him to continue “thinking about the cross-over between games and literature” and “the process of creating something that someone else gets to play” throughout his phd program. since that initial encounter with writing and gaming, he has taught multiple iterations of his game-based writing course, both at the 3000- and 1000-level, at various institutions, including at the university of georgia and georgia tech. when “pitching” the course to students, dr. king emphasizes the experiential nature of reading/writing a text and playing games. for him, game design is about choice and creating experiences for the player in the same way that texts implement specific rhetorical choices to shape a certain experience for the reader. when “you’re reading, you’re having the experience based on the words someone else wrote,” an experience “designed” by the writer. “games do the same thing” because “when you’re playing a game, you’re having fun or you’re being frustrated or you’re competing with people because of rules that someone else made.” while “a read experience is kind of quiet. it’s so internalized, and reading is so familiar that we really don’t think about it,” “playing a game is a loud experience” that demonstrates how choice “create[s] experiences” that “move us.” even as he strives to revitalize rhetoric for students through video games, he notes that in many respects, his game-based writing classroom is still “a traditional writing and rhetoric class,” though you will see students playing games such as the stanley parable and what remains of edith finch . students learn about the writing process, rhetorical devices, and academic research as they discuss texts such as richard lamb’s economies of attention and shira chess’s ready player two. dr. king designs the course so that the “[video] games are happening alongside more traditional academic texts,” and students begin to see how both texts and video games construct meaning and “work as rhetoric.” he uses the stanley parable to “talk about how choice works” in game design and writing. when students play what remains of edith finch, a “more narrative” and “story-based game,” they discuss how the game “create[s] meaning” and “work[s]…as storytelling.” throughout the course, dr. king emphasizes to students that “when they’re writing something, they’re still creating an experience” as they “think about an audience,” “structure something,” and “make rhetorical devices in…writing.” as students design their own games for the final project, they create these “experiences” through a platform that makes rhetorical choices “really noticeable,” a process that is often too “subtle” for students when their exposure to rhetoric is limited to traditional texts. dr. king “sets apart” his most recent version of the course, a 3000-level class taught in fall 2022, as the most “impressive” one because of a small change to the final project. what “sets this [class] apart from all other ones” is his decision to give students the whole semester to design their games instead of only 4-6 weeks. with only a month to work on their projects, students felt that their projects “were over before they really got to dig in.” in fall 2022, dr. king also tried out “studio mondays,” which were designated workdays that alternated between guided workshops, “guided play tests” between students, and individual, self-guided work time. he was prepared to “stop doing studio mondays if it stops being productive,” but “it never did.” every monday, students were “doing amazing, impressive things. they had real questions, they had work lists, they divided things and used monday…to assign themselves work for the rest of the week.” seeing students actively guide themselves through their projects was one of the most rewarding aspects of the course for dr. king. the most constructive move that writing instructors can make, dr. king suggests, is “defamiliarizing” the familiar for students. he “defamiliarizes rhetoric” through game-playing, urging students to question what it means to play a game and read a text or to design a game and write a text. there is value, he contends, in teaching writing “unconventionally” and “approaching it from [a] different angle” because an unfamiliar approach “takes this thing that we think is really normal and boring, like writing and reading and…dramatizes the fact that it’s not normal or boring at all. that it’s really sophisticated and complex.” instructors should “[find] new ways of talking about [writing and rhetoric]” because it “keeps us limber and keeps us more aware of how texts we’re surrounded by work.” students “think about rhetoric a little differently, maybe even a little bit more broadly after taking a class with a weird focus.” defamiliarizing the first year writing classroom allows students to realize that rhetoric is built into everything we experience. in that way, defamiliarizing rhetoric simultaneously foregrounds how familiar rhetoric is by emphasizing how much our daily lives are “surrounded” by it. as students realize how “language moves us,” the fact that language moves the world and that we “move” language daily becomes tangibly, powerfully ordinary. for dr. king, the first year writing classroom is a space in which the normal becomes as defamiliarized as it is familiarized. only then can we “keep limber” our experiences of language. brianna phillips is an english ph.d. student and fyw instructor in the english department

"unknown","when i meet dr. eberle, she’s just returned from the special collections library. the course she’s teaching this semester, a single-author study on jane austen, had gone to see samples of regency era fabric—exactly what characters in jane austen’s novels would have worn. the samples would become part of one of her student’s creative projects, which she shows me proudly. “it’s something i’ll miss,” she says. “experiencing the joy of students making these rediscoveries and sharing it.” it’s poetic that dr. eberle is finishing her career at uga teaching austen, as at the beginning of her career at uga she taught the first class offered by uga on jane austen. she continued to teach austen and 18th and 19th century british literature. twenty-nine years later, she’s held positions in administration: two terms as the undergraduate coordinator, one as social media coordinator, and most recently she was associate head for two years. no matter what position she held, though, dr. eberle always maintained her passion for teaching. she says that one of the things she’ll miss most is the moments of unique insight and discovery that can only be found in the classroom. “there are just moments of pure joy,” she says. moments where she introduces a student to a novel or poem, and they have an insight that “blows my mind.” there are funny moments too; for example, when a student titled an essay “samuel taylor coleridge, the drug addict” after she had mentioned his addiction to laudanum in passing. dr. eberle felt it was an important lesson for her future teaching philosophies, which are largely informed by making sure students have proper context and biography, so that they can better engage with and understand the work. later in her career, dr. eberle feels fortunate to have been able to mentor a host of wonderful graduate students. “watching them grow and flourish has been really important—truly priceless,” she says. paralleling her love of teaching is dr. eberle’s love of books. “i got my first purse when i was eight, and i got it solely for the purpose of keeping books in there,” she says, laughing. her love of books was always a part of her life, but dr. eberle began her undergraduate career at suny buffalo as a psychology major. she switched to communications, thinking of taking a business focus, but “this whole time i was taking english courses. and at a certain point i realize i’m an english major.” after graduating, dr. eberle applied to graduate schools while working at a fotomat (i had to google what that was). “i was chewing gum and reading a magazine, and i got a call from ucla offering me a fellowship.” at ucla, her dissertation shifted from virginia woolf to a passion that has endured for her: lesser-known women writers of the romantic era. while she loved—and still loves—virginia woolf and the well-known writers of that period, she “[loves] the detective work of learning about these women writers, who had been so well-known in their period, but completely forgotten with time.” after 29 years at uga, though, dr. eberle is looking forward to the future. “i’ve loved every minute, but i’m also pretty excited about the next stage,” she says. in california, where dr. eberle plans to move with her husband, waits a sizable family, and her daughter, who is finishing her last year at berkeley. the project she is most anticipating is finishing her second book, amelia opie’s sociable lives , and reading all of virginia woolf’s writing— “from the very beginning to the very end in chronological order, inclusive of novels, letters, and diaries.” she says she feels it’s fitting to her “narrative arc” because her journey in academia began with virginia woolf, so it provides a satisfying symmetry to wrap it up the same way. most important to dr. eberle, though, is to never stop growing. “you have to keep discovering things, even when it’s different; maybe it’s even more important to discover something that is unexpected.” jessica schumaker is a third-year english major and the media intern for the english department."

then applying those concepts to a comparative analysis of two book-length literary works (in different genres for added degree of difficulty). does that sound like a lot for six pages? that's a lot for six pages! had he pulled off a pretty good version of the task, i would have been impressed. i was well beyond impressed. the finished essay weaves in 43 direct quotations -- from psychological theory, secondary criticism of his texts, and of course from the texts themselves -- without breaking stride. most importantly and most impressively, the essay leaves me with a better understanding of both o'brien's the things they carried (which we didn't read for class, by the way) and trethewey's native guard .\" beginning in 2007, the english department began recognizing the excellent work being done in eportfolios for english 1101 and 1102 by presenting the portfolio awards. named in honor of michael g. moran, a former director of fyw who did much to shape and improve the program and who has continued to support it by serving loyally on the first-year writing committee, these awards also consist of cash prizes and publication of selected exhibits from the winning eportfolios in the first-year writing guide. these awards are supported by the english department fund . sky smith sky is a first-year student from tyrone, georgia who is currently undecided. she has always fancied writing as a creative outlet, especially songwriting, and has been inspired by taylor swift’s lyrics for as long as she can remember. she is currently a member of the agency and hopes to become involved in more fine arts clubs and organizations on campus. her passions include traveling, going to concerts, cooking, trying new restaurants, music analysis, and critiquing matcha lattes. sky was nominated by phillip brown : \"sky smith’s portfolio is an accomplished work that showcases a high degree of creativity and rhetorical skill. through the metaphors of dance and music, sky illuminates the give-and-take nature of the writing process—the discipline it requires and the opportunities it offers for self-expression. sky uses creative design elements to compliment her exhibits, taking the reader further into her writing and peer review processes, and leaving the reader with a show stopping wildcard exhibit. as a whole, sky’s work is endlessly engaging, and exemplifies the writing process in both content and form.\" ishika mehta ishika is an advertising major with a double minor in communications and korean language, here at the university of georgia. ishika's longstanding fondness for the arts finds its expression through diverse avenues that traverse visual, performance, as well as language arts. as an indian classical dancer with over 12 years of rigorous formal training, she constantly looks for ways to integrate her passion for dance with her work at school. to ishika, her portfolio was one such opportunity to proudly share the beauty of kathak and to showcase her enduring love for the art form with students and staff at the university of georgia. whether it be on stage or on paper, she strives to produce work that resonates with her audience and speaks to the heart. ishika continues to look for opportunities that will allow her to grow as a student and individual. she credits much of her success and motivation to her parents, who have been consistently supportive and enthusiastic throughout her academic career, as well as her kathak guru, kumud savla, who brought her to this point in her dance journey. ishika was nominated by sarah turula: \"ishika’s central idea is that all art is, in some sense, a form of “storytelling.” what is so impressive about her eportfolio is that she uses so many different media to convey this theme. these exhibits contain video, dance, essay-writing – even clothing and jewelry – and they all combine to tell one many-faceted story about who ishika is: a writer, a performer, a human, a storyteller.\" shelby williams shelby williams (she/her) is a second-year student currently pursuing her undergraduate degree with a double major in both psychology (neuroscience emphasis) and english at the university of georgia. after obtaining her degree, she plans to earn her ph.d. in psychology and work as a developmental psychologist or therapist. additionally, she would like to pursue academic research, write, and self-publish some of her own works and content ranging from poetry, prose, and beyond. you can currently find some of her poetry in uga's own stillpoint literary magazine 's 54th edition. she also highlights her creative reflections with her peers and the public through an account she created under the handle @odetoprose. when not writing, she also enjoys playing flute, painting, and expressing herself artistically through her other passion - dance - with the filipino student association and pamoja dance company. expressing herself through avenues such as writing and dance brings her an immense sense of contentment and provides balance and cathartic release from the rigor of academic studies. shelby was nominated by liz hammock : \"as a student, shelby demonstrates a most varied sense in ideas, subjects, and observational, critical thinking about the world around her. she relishes writing about culture and art with a kind of flair and style i don’t see often. embracing quirk, charm, and directness, shelby manages to engage her readers with unexpected turns of her ideas. i think it’s in her sense of owning her writing and looking to create space for fun in the way we read and discern art forms. she has both the capacity of the critic and that of the roving writer, comfortable in both modes. she is also quite capable in representing that, in conveying her process in either mode.\" english department winner: savannah jensen the center for teaching and learning administers the excellence in teaching award (eta), sponsored by the graduate

"unknown","dr. roland végső is a professor and current department head who specializes in literary/critical theory and 20th-century literatures with a special emphasis on transnational modernism. his last name is pronounced like the word “vague,” plus “shuh,” but he prefers roland. roland was born to an intellectually driven family mostly composed of mathematicians and engineers in nyíregyháza, hungary in the midst of the cold war. although his family encouraged him to follow in their footsteps, roland found that literature provided a way to imagine life outside of the historical circumstances he grew up in. roland entered university right after the cold war, when hungarian academia was trying to reignite its intellectual traditions, and what he called a “transitional decade.” “people were really all over the country, looking for new ideas, and trying to imagine a completely new future that was unimaginable to that point,” said roland. “so it was very exciting to be at the university at that time.” during his time at the university of debrecen, roland became interested in the hungarian literary philosopher, györgy lukács, whose work was largely forgotten in the 90s. roland’s work led him to a university in germany, but hungary was not part of the eu at the time, making logistics difficult. one of his advisors suggested he apply to american universities where he would have more opportunities, and he accepted an offer from state university of new york at buffalo. his first job was at the university of tennessee, knoxville, and then he worked for the university of nebraska-lincoln for 9 years before arriving at uga. outside of his job, roland spends most of his time with his children, but he also enjoys music, yoga, and walking. although he grew up listening to many athens-based musicians, he never visited until his interview for his current job. before visiting, roland saw athens as an almost mythical location, but now he has settled and enjoyed all that the city has to offer. welcome to uga, roland!"
"unknown","clare reid is the manager of the first-year writing program, where she manages day-to-day operations such as managing schedules, the calendar, the list-serv, and deals with student complaints. basically, she says, “if it comes to first-year writing, it comes to me first.” her main passion in this job is pedagogy outreach; two years ago at georgetown she taught graduate students how to teach. prior to her current job, she received an undergraduate degree in classical civilizations from emory, a masters in english at georgetown, and also worked as a freelance graphic designer. clare is exceedingly passionate about pedagogy and professional development. with her color-coded spreadsheets, binders, and journals, she stays on top of everything in her role as a “catch-all” for first-year writing. she enjoys reading the variety of syllabi within english 1101 and 1102, especially the unique topics, such as horror, walt whitman, and even the percy jackson series. though she currently serves over 2,000 students, she calls the spring semester the “quiet semester.” helping faculty manage the high volume of students by providing them with aids from pedagogical resources and training to office supplies, she says, is one of the highlights of her job. eventually, clare wishes to pursue a ph.d through uga’s paid tuition for faculty program, likely following a similar subject as her masters: medieval art, specifically art made by nuns and religious women in the 12th and 13th centuries. her work focuses on medieval art made by these women as it relates to “embodied cognition”—the process of flowed thinking, when the body is doing a physical task but the mind operates in a flowing state of thought. “the nuns used work and specifically artistic creation as a form of mediation and prayer,” she says. “and they were aware of this concept of flow…and why they were doing their art.” her passion derives from the fact that this undiscussed history rebukes much of the common perceptions about middle-age women, which often characterize them as isolated and having little intelligent thought, much less artistic ability. because of this interest, clare focused on the art and lives of these medieval women for her master’s capstone project, which you can find here . it’s a very impressive multi-media project that showcases six activities based on what she describes as “multi-century, multi-modal ways to experience the art medieval nuns were doing.” you can even recreate some of the nuns’ art! beyond park hall, clare says she reads “a shocking number of books”—90 last year and 28 so far this year (probably much higher now, as this article was published weeks after the interview). she likes to be in touch with her artistic side; she knits, cooks, sews, paints, and keeps a bullet journal, which i’m sure is very detailed. her favorite thing to bake is bread; she described in detail how she bakes three loaves a week for herself and her fiance! she is also a veteran of nanowrimo, having spent a decade completing the challenge annually. but she’s a bit worried about completing it this year: “i’m getting married this year, and i’m having my wedding in the middle of november—am i going to get it done?” she laughs. “we’ll see.” she enjoys the projects that come out of the race against the clock that is nanowrimo, whether they be good or just ridiculous fun. to our interview, i asked clare who her favorite poets are. she has great taste; she recited sappho, mary oliver, and billy collins in the span of minutes. a poem of mary oliver’s, whom she described as one of her favorite poets from childhood, has turned in my head for hours. it is what mary oliver said at her partner’s funeral: “ when we pray to love god perfectly, / surely we do not mean only. / (lord, see how well i have done.).” just one floor up from clare, i found peyton mitchell in her office. peyton mitchell is the office assistant for park hall and the assistant for uga’s creative writing program. she graduated from uga quite recently—in fall 2022—with a bachelor of fine arts in drawing and painting. because she didn’t want to leave athens just yet, she found a place within park hall as the office assistant, which handles mail distribution, student questions, and general office management. her passion for her current position stems from its creative opportunities, such as designing promotional materials for the english ph.d and creative writing programs and event planning. mitchell’s natural creativity drew her to art from a young age. “my mom has a painting hanging in my childhood home that i did when i was three,” she says, smiling fondly. though she dabbled in interdisciplinary modes of art, such as 2-d and 3-d, her heart always gravitates towards drawing and painting. the first step she took to becoming professionally trained was not at uga, but georgia southern, where she spent two years. as she was nearing the end of her second year, she felt she and her husband—who was also going to school there—needed a change, so they moved to athens around the same time the pandemic began. it was at uga that mitchell created “lost in intimate reverie,” her exit show for the lamar dodd school of art. her work is influenced by the impressionist movement because of how the artists redefined the use of light in painting, and especially monet. “i love that towards the end of his life, monet was defining things a lot less…it became about color,” she says. she wanted to incorporate undefined style and use of light into her own work. “my paintings are of flowers and landscapes but what i’m really engaging with is color.” i don’t really think ‘engaging’ quite captures what mitchell does with color; she embodies it in her art. the hues—neon orange, fuschia, deep blues and violets—explode from the canvas and ignite a spark in the mind. beneath the vibrancy of her art lies a determination: “my goal in painting is not to focus on personal traumas…i don’t owe you my hardship. i want to create light and a space for people to get lost in that.” to get lost in the light, take a look at mitchell’s work here . beyond work, mitchell and her husband can be seen within molly’s and thousand faces coffee on the weekends. in her free time, mitchell enjoys crochet (her first project was a jacket) and reading, especially poetry and novels. fantasy is her favorite genre, which she links to the escapism intrinsic to her identity as a painter. her favorite poet is mary oliver; she decorated her graduation cap with the final two lines from mary oliver’s poem “the summer day”: “tell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?” mitchell seems to be doing very well with hers. (that’s two hits for mary oliver!) jessica schumaker is an english major at uga and the social media intern for the english department."

"unknown","kate o’brien’s fiction has rarely been read as modernist. yet, like the satirical exercises of her late modernist contemporaries samuel beckett and flann o’brien, her writing forms a critique of the political and social specifics of late free state ireland. o’brien’s 1938 novel pray for the wanderer is part of a collection of irish novels published in the late 1930s which exhibit a late modernist concern with the relationship between art and its political context(s). like beckett’s murphy (1938) and flann o’brien’s at swim-two-birds (1939), the novel’s central character is an irish man and artist who is alienated from an ireland in which “the family is the fundamental unit group of society” (the constitution of ireland 1937, article 41.1.2). pray for the wanderer grapples uneasily with the transition from the irish free state to éire and the dawning of a political frontier in which catholic values are not only predominant, but are firmly manifest in the constitution. although the novel has been read primarily as an eloquent response to censorship, the irish constitution of 1937 is the focal point for o’brien’s concerns about the erosion of individual liberty. written concurrently with the drafting of the constitution, the novel probes the ideologies of familism and pro-natalism in their legislative and social forms, exploring their impact on art, citizenship and personal autonomy at a political turning point in post-independence ireland. focusing on pray for the wanderer and drawing on archival material including dáil debates, this talk will explore how o’brien’s critique of the relationship between citizenship and familism in ireland invites us to reconsider her work as part of a later phase of irish and transnational modernism. dr laura lovejoy is a postdoctoral fellow at the school of english, university college cork. she is currently working on a monograph, \"ireland, late modernism and reproduction\", which explores the relationship between late irish modernism and reproductive politics. the monograph considers how a collection of novels by james joyce, samuel beckett, flann o'brien and kate o'brien responded to the ideologies of domesticity, pro-natalism and familism as they were manifest in the political landscape of free state ireland. her research interests include historical approaches to modernism, biopolitics, and the relationship between modernism and commercial sex. her work has been published in humanities . this lecture is sponsored by the willson center and the interdisciplinary modernisms workshop"

"unknown","in a 1780 parliamentary speech, “on economical reform,” edmund burke asserts that the british royal household “has lost all that was stately and venerable in the antique manners, without retrenching anything of the cumbrous charge of a gothic establishment” and is populated by “grim spectres of departed tyrants—the saxon, the norman, and the dane; the stern edwards and fierce henries—who stalk from desolation to desolation, through the dreary vacuity, and melancholy succession of chill and comfortless chambers.” the proposed reforms that burke introduced with that speech included efforts to replace the household as personal institution with modern impersonal systems of governance. this talk will argue that ann radcliffe’s narratives (particularly the mysteries of udolpho ) enact a kind of household reform/modernization that is homologous to what burke pursues, and that also catches the oikos /household in its transmutation from a slightly-less-figural component of pre- and proto-capitalist systems (which in many respects actually were households) to the deep oikos metaphor in the circuitry of full-fledged capitalist for which home might be a better synonym. scott mackenzie (associate professor, university of british columbia) specializes in eighteenth-century studies. his first book be it ever so humble: poverty, fiction, and the invention of the middle-class home (u of virginia press, 2013) won the walker cowen prize for a study on an eighteenth-century topic. the book argues that fiction and discourse about poverty in britain in the later eighteenth century collaborate to invent modern private domesticity and the first occupants of home — at least conceptually — are the poor rather than the middle-classes, who rapidly appropriate home for themselves. mackenzie has published articles in eighteenth-century fiction , elh , eighteenth-century studies , and pmla . the georgia colloquium in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century british literature is supported by the willson center for humanities and arts and by the english department's rodney baine lecture fund. this lecture is free and open to the public."
"unknown","a number of contemporary digital media works, such as lisa reihana’s installation “in pursuit of venus [infected]/emissaries” (2015-2017) and tracy fullerton’s video game “walden” (2017), have returned to panoramic strategies of representation to reimagine totalizing and seemingly transcendent concepts like empire and nature. reihana’s and fullerton’s approaches are partially archival, drawing directly on printed works produced during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and highlighting the uncertain line between virtual worlds and augmented archives. both look back to a precise historical period (the 1770’s-1850’s), typically associated with urban, industrial and political revolutions in the atlantic as well as dramatic changes in visual technology connected to these, including the invention of the panorama itself (1787-92). fullerton’s recreation of thoreau’s concord and walden pond is more classical, virtual and even cinematic, a paradoxically technological transcendentalism of play focused on the observing subject. conversely, reihana’s more explicitly panoramic work about the cook expeditions, which emerges from ‘polynesian’ auckland, suggests in its layers and reenactments a more distributed and indeed augmented agency in the pacific when compared with the ‘atlantic world.’ why walden pond might appear more virtual and a pacific island more augmented can be better understood by returning to the archives of two print-age pacific expeditions by james cook and george macartney. both men ostensibly failed in their imperial tasks, and yet the printed journals and engravings of the expeditions, including the french wallpaper that reihana draws upon, became fundamental to new conceptions of nature and empire in the late eighteenth century. such media objects indicate the use of a more consciously panoramic approach to counter anxiety over erratic failures of mastery and masculinity in a revolutionary age. at the same time, material objects ( taonga / taoa ) brought back to london from the pacific like the tahitian mourner’s costume from the three cook voyages (1769-1779) as well as the macartney tapestry and collection of gifts from his embassy to beijing (1793) could belie optimistic visions of empire and prove resistant panoramic strategies of synthesis. key to the power of reihana’s and fullerton’s interventions is their use of archival strategies that return the participant to the disjunctions of the revolutionary panoramic, highlighting the uneasy relation between a totalizing technoscientific optimism and the archive. robert batchelor is professor of history and director of digital humanities at georgia southern university. he is the author of london: the selden map and the making of a global city, 1549-1689 (chicago, 2014). with sari gilbert, he created the board game fujian trader (2016) based on his discovery of the selden map of china. he is currently working on several projects related to maritime and ocean history. the georgia colloquium in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century british literature is supported by the willson center for humanities and arts and by the english department's rodney baine lecture fund. uga's history department is a co-sponsor of dr. batchelor's lecture, which is free and open to the public."

"unknown","the question of how (or why, or whether) to commingle queer theory and ecocriticism has become an urgent concern for many theorists writing in the wake of timothy morton’s 2010 pmla essay “queer ecology.” while greg garrard, for example, thinks that queer theory needs ecocriticism in order to avoid theoretical bankruptcy and irrelevance, jordy rosenberg argues exactly the opposite, warning that certain versions of eco-theory are guilty of promulgating “a primitivist fantasy that hinges on the violent erasure of the social: the conjuring of a realm—an ‘ancestral realm’—that exists in the present, but in parallax to historical time.” this talk will develop rosenberg's analysis by taking up the question of eco-queer futurity in three emblematic victorian texts: emily bronte’s 1847 novel wuthering heights , matthew arnold’s 1867 poem “dover beach,” and gerard manley hopkins’s “binsey poplars” (1879). each of these works embodies an iteration of queerness that simultaneously challenges the hegemony of reproductive futurism described by theorists leo bersani and lee edelman and disavows the utopianist collectivity of much recent queer studies scholarship. this talk will aim to demonstrate how eco-queer readings of these works can illuminate the clashing temporal and spatial scales at work in their deep logic, and thereby draw out their conflicted investment in nascent ideologies of economic and environmental stewardship. deanna kreisel (associate professor, university of british columbia) specializes in victorian literature and culture. her first book, economic woman: demand, gender, and narrative closure in eliot and hardy (toronto 2012), examines how images of feminized sexuality in the mid-victorian realist novel reflected widespread contemporary anxieties about the growth of capitalism. kreisel is co-founder of vcologies, an international working group of nineteenth-centuryist scholars interested in ecocriticism and environmental studies. she has published articles in pmla , victorian studies , representations, and elh , and is currently at work on a new book on the history of the sustainability concept and utopianism in the nineteenth century. the georgia colloquium in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century british literature is supported by the willson center for humanities and arts and by the english department's rodney baine lecture fund. this lecture is free and open to the public."

"unknown","jonathan sachs is professor of english at concordia university in montreal and principal investigator of the montreal-based interacting with print research group. his work focuses on british literature from 1750-1850, where his research explores the role of literature in constructing historical and temporal experience, including the uses of antiquity, the anticipation of the future, and practices of reading. his research has been supported by multiple awards from the sshrc (canada) and by residential fellowships at the institute for advanced study in princeton and the national humanities center (us). he is the author of the poetics of decline in british romanticism (cambridge, 2018), romantic antiquity: rome in the british imagination, 1789-1832 (oxford, 2010), and co-author, with the multigraph collective, of interacting with print: elements of reading in an era of print saturation (chicago, 2018). sachs is currently at work, with andrew stauffer, on a new one-volume edition of byron’s major works (under contract with oxford university press) and on a new monograph, slow time. in slow violence and the environmentalism of the poor (2011), rob nixon proposes a recasting of the glacial as “a rousing, iconic image of unacceptably fast loss.” this is a striking formulation, but, while ecologically sensitive critics can sympathize both with the urgency and the aims of nixon’s intervention, it overlooks how an earlier eighteenth-century and romantic awareness of the increased speed and acceleration of contemporary life is already suffused with the recognition of an attendant slowness. slow time does create formal problems, as nixon insists, but these formal problems are not new. they might better be understood as eighteenth-century problems whose terms and contours, whose representational experiments we can recognize especially in the later years of the century. working off of nixon and contemporary historians and social theorists like reinhart koselleck, hartmut rosa, paul virilio and jonathan crary, all of whom posit experiences of acceleration as central to what we often call modernity, the talk proposes a fraught and productive relationship between speed and slowness as characteristic of temporal experience in the eighteenth century and beyond. i do not propose to offer an explicit elaboration of slow time per say, nor a direct statement of what it does for us as a literary critical concept; instead, i seek to approach a sense of what slow time might be and what it might do as a critical concept through a series of seven intentionally contradictory propositions. a reception in the robert west library, park hall 261 will follow dr. sachs's talk. the talk and reception are free and open to the public, and are sponsored by the english department's rodney baine lecture fund, the willson center for humanities and arts, and uga's history department."

"unknown","\"global aestheticism and the invention of japan: cosmopolitan encounters around 1900,\" a lecture by stefano evangelista in ‘the decay of lying’ (1889), oscar wilde declared that ‘the whole of japan is a pure invention. there is no such country, there are no such people.’ wilde’s provocative statement makes fun of the fashion for japonisme that was sweeping across europe and north america in the late nineteenth century, providing inspiration for artists and writers. his denial of the existence of japan is a gesture of cosmopolitan disillusionment: in an age of mass tourism and increasingly globalised modernity, distance, desire and projection are the only meaningful ways of preserving cultural difference. this paper charts the ‘invention’ of japan in english literature, starting from wilde’s aphorism and james mcneill whistler’s pictorial aestheticism. it will explore the construction of japan in the work of the irish writer lafcadio hearn, who moved to japan in 1890 and stayed there until his death in 1904. hearn, who gave up his british nationality in order to become a naturalised japanese, experimented with a style and literary forms that sought to combine the record of authentic experience and the aesthetic anti-realism advocated by wilde. stefano evangelista teaches english literature at oxford university. he specializes in british and comparative literature, with a focus on the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the history of sexuality. he is the author or hellenism, reception, gods in exile: british aestheticism and ancient greece (2009) and his edited volumes include the reception of oscar wilde in europe (2010), algernon charles swinburne: unofficial laureate (2013), literature and sculpture in the fin de siècle (2017) and, most recently, arthur symons: poet, critic, vagabond (2018). he is currently completing a monograph on literary cosmopolitanism at the turn of the twentieth century, for which he has been awarded a british academy mid-career fellowship. a reception in the robert west library, park hall 261 will follow dr. evangelista's talk. the lecture and reception are free and open to the public, and are sponsored by the english department's rodney baine lecture fund and the willson center for humanities and arts. dr. evangelista's talk has been co-sponsored by the uga at oxford program."

"unknown","as timothy brennan argues, postcolonial studies b r i n gs to g e th e r “ g lo b a li z ing fea tu r e s of wo r ld histo r y a nd hum a n s o c i e t i e s” and “ c oloni a l p rac ti ce s a nd a nti c oloni a l c h a ll e n g e s”. the interdisciplinary approach embraced by postcolonial studies provides a variety of academic tools and perspectives to study the social, cultural, and psychological aftermath of colonialism and the identity crisis generated in the wake of decolonization. independence efforts in the indian subcontinent following the world war ii as well as the grassroots movements targeting colonial regimes in northern africa have paved the way towards a rethinking of the power dynamics by challenging eurocentric and orientalist ways of defining the other. postcolonial theory disrupts western cultural and political hegemony by “giving natives the permission to tell their own stories”—as edward said puts it. an important aspect of this critical approach is to scrutinize the dehumanization and exploitation of the native under colonial rule (albert memmi, aime cesaire), the formation of national consciousness (bill ashcroft et al.), and the role of violence in establishing sovereign states as well as sovereign individuals (fanon). in addition, postcolonial studies sheds light on the complicated nature of contact zones that prepare the conditions for acculturation, interculturation, cultural synthesis and hybridity (walcott, brathwaite, bhabha) and bolsters discussions about “decoloniality” (mignolo) to complicate border studies. as postcolonial theory branches into other areas of academic investigation (such as diaspora studies, minority studies, subaltern studies, ethnic studies, etc.), it helps evaluate the shifting significations of “home”—for those who cross borders to abandon their homes of origin to adopt new ones, as well as those who remain in their “natural” homes only to witness significant transformations around them. as we enter the 21st century, postcolonial literature and theory helps reinvigorate rece nt d e b a t e s on “ w o r ld” a nd “ g lob a l” lit e r a t u res , neocolonialism, n e olib e ra lism, decoloniliaty with an eye toward redefining humanism and secularism in new contexts."
"unknown","the uga graduate program in english offers a wide range of courses in british and irish literature of the nineteenth through the twenty-first centuries. we teach courses on historical periods and genres together with seminars on individual authors (austen, blake, dickens, hardy, joyce, woolf) and literary movements (romanticism, the gothic, impressionism, the avant garde). we also offer seminars on a variety of special topics arising from faculty research, including (to name some of the most recent) \"the kafkaesque,\" \"urban modernity,\" \"impressionism in england,\" \"modernism and the aristocracy,\" \"britain between the wars,\" \"victorian femininity, nationhood, and the black atlantic,\" \"patriotism and victorian poetry,\" \"contemporary irish poetry,\" and \"literature, media, and information in the nineteenth century.\" our approaches to these topics are similarly diverse. faculty strengths include archival research; formal and textual analysis; textual editing; feminist criticism and theory; and cultural and interdisciplinary studies. this area of literary study also generates a significant amount of creative and intellectual activity outside the seminar room. thanks to various sources of support in the department and the university, we regularly host distinguished lecturers from other institutions. the uga willson center for humanities and arts has funded lectures by paula feldman, james longenbach, michael north, and michael wood. recent visitors in the lanier speakers series, sponsored by helen s. lanier distinguished professor jed rasula, include daniel albright, fredric jameson, louis menand, marjorie perloff, and rei tarada. the department has hosted readings by three prominent irish poets: ciaran carson, michael longley, and paul muldoon. the british women’s writers conference, featuring keynote speeches by susan gubar, yopie prins, and susan wolfson, was held at uga in 2004. the georgia colloquium in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature is a new speakers program that promotes intellectual inquiry across the disciplines and offers graduate students the opportunity to present a dissertation chapter or job talk to the department. each semester the colloquium brings several speakers, both regional and national, to campus. our graduate students have the benefit of a first-rate library, in which ample permanent holdings are bolstered by an excellent interlibrary loan department and access to such electronic resources as literature online, women writers online, and project muse. students have also been successful in obtaining funds--from both internal and external sources--for archival research at various locations including the british film institute, the new york public library, and the harry ransom research center in austin, texas. a new addition to these resources is the hugh kenner professorship fund, which was established in 2006. uga's oxford program offers opportunities for study and research in oxford."
"unknown","the study of rhetoric and composition at the university of georgia provides students with a foundational understanding of rhetorical theory, the history of rhetoric, composition theory and pedagogy, and rhetorical approaches to literary texts. additionally, students can pursue the study of writing within the emerging field of electronic textuality and its relation to other areas of study, such as humanities computing and literary theory. students who select rhetoric and composition as one of their areas of specialization do so with varying purposes: some students seek to supplement their traditional literary studies with principles of rhetorical analyses; others wish to prepare themselves more fully to teach writing at the secondary or college level; and still others aim to pursue an academic career in rhetoric and composition. we are pleased that our students have done well on the job market, taking tenure?track jobs at institutions such as the university of mississippi, the university of carolina at greensboro, virginia military institute, virginia institute of technology, columbus state university, millsaps college, belmont abbey college, and kennesaw university. students who elect to pursue the m.a. with a concentration in rhetoric and composition complete - in addition to the other requirements for the degree - three courses from the area (such as the history of rhetoric, composition theory and pedagogy, rhetoric and literature, and current topics in rhetoric). additionally, students complete an appropriate capstone project, such as a thesis. the topics of recent m.a. theses have ranged from a study of rhetoric and the law in the merchant of venice, a examination of rhetorical theory and the novels of tim o'brien, to a rhetorical analysis of pharmaceutical advertising. the m.a. with a concentration in rhetoric and composition should be of interest to students who wish to teach at the secondary or college level after obtaining the m.a. or who wish to pursue doctoral studies in rhetoric. students pursuing a ph.d. in english at uga are required to select and to be examined on three areas of specialization. those students desiring to specialize in rhetoric and composition, in addition to other program requirements, complete courses offered in the area, including the history of rhetoric, composition theory and pedagogy, rhetoric and literature, and specially offered seminars in current rhetorical theory, such as issues in the historiography of the history of rhetoric; antifoundationalism and rhetorical theory; burke, booth, bakhtin, and literary analysis; markup technologies and the rhetorical canons; rhetoric, law, and literature. additionally, the ph.d. student constructs - in consultation with his/her major professor - a reading list for the comprehensive exam. the reading list will include standard texts in the history of rhetoric and in rhetoric and composition, but it may be shaped to reflect the student's other interests and projected dissertation topic. for instance, past students have combined an interest in historical rhetoric and medieval studies, rhetoric and composition and creativity theory, rhetoric and african-american literature, feminism and composition, rhetoric and the new journalism, composition and creative writing, rhetoric and composition and the essay as a genre, rhetoric and composition and romanticism, rhetoric and the twentieth-century novel, rhetoric and scientific writing, and rhetoric and electronic textuality. students specializing in rhetoric and composition, like all students in the department of english, are eligible for graduate research assistantships and graduate teaching assistantships. students with teaching assistantships teach in the first-year composition program. advanced students can serve as support tas for large lecture sections of sophomore literature as well as for the \"gateway\" undergraduate course, \"introduction to english studies,\" and then as teacher of record for smaller sections of the sophomore courses. teaching assistants may also have an opportunity to teach on-line sections of composition, to serve as computer-support tas as well as to develop experimental versions of first-year composition. advanced students may also serve as tutors in the uga writing center. at times, advanced students with background in rhetoric have taught the upper-division writing courses: technical writing, advanced composition, and writing for the world wide web."
"unknown","although often stereotyped as the “nation’s other,” the south has participated in every military conflict since the civil war, and like the nation, has been transformed by the rise of cities, multinational corporations, and webbed systems of transportation and communication. increasingly, it has interacted - as it always has - with the circumcaribbean, through trade, political ruptures and treaties, cultural exchanges, and mutual cultural influences, particularly music, art, and dance. concurrently, southerners have had transnational contacts with europe and africa, from the tragedy of the middle passage to this century’s of international exchanges of all kinds. as a crucial component of southern culture, southern literature has mapped histories of native americans, diasporic africans, colonization, slavery, immigration, agriculture, industrialization, and increasingly, urbanization. while the study of southern cultures once was concentrated in literature and history, it has expanded to include food studies, climate studies, race and gender studies, ethnic studies (especially african american and native studies), queer studies, and popular culture, which includes film, television, graphic works, music, and digital media. these developments have been absorbed by the “new southern studies,” which has generated many new approaches to the u.s. south and its larger configurations with the circumcaribbean, the hemisphere, and the atlantic world. critics such as richard gray, patricia yaeger, martyn bone, harriet pollack, thadious davis, jose limón, trudier harris, keith cartwright, anna brickhouse, gary richards and susan donaldson have put a new slant on the field of southern literature. also, the configuration of the u.s. south with the caribbean has brought in theoretical perspectives from figures such as édouard glissant, j. michael dash, valérie loichot, deborah cohn, and vincent pérez. historians such as david blight, marcus rediker, rebecca j. scott, matthew guterl, nell painter, michael trouillot, daniel heath justice, chadwick allen, and rod ferguson and others have reshaped our concepts of southern and circumcaribbean history. many uga students hail from the south, so this focus on its cultural history and heritage comprises a valuable and magnetic mirror, one that reflects the confluences, conflicts, and inheritance of a polyglot people. this southern studies concentration thereby offers a valuable foundation for negotiations with our nation’s present and futures."

"unknown","medieval and early modern studies at the university of georgia is a central pillar of british and irish studies, material textualities, and theories of cultural representation at uga. students frequently write dissertations within a wide array of critical approaches: cultural and interdisciplinary studies; feminist criticism and women's writing; formalist and textual analysis; performance studies; folklore; shakespearean and other appropriations; and rhetorical approaches to literature. graduate seminars vary from traditional, author-based surveys (beowulf, shakespeare, milton) to special topics (“chaucer and everything after,” “the early modern body,” “shakespeare and appropriation”); students can also train in early languages of the british isles (old english, middle english, middle welsh) while pursuing theoretical approaches (“performance theory,” “shakespeare and feminist theory”). students are encouraged to develop methods and archival research skills appropriate to their area of the study, and to draw upon uga’s medieval and early modern strengths in departments like history, theater, romance language, and germanic languages. we also encourage professional training and development, regularly sending graduate students on competitive teaching assistantships to work ly with an oxford don over the summer and to undertake research at the bodleian library as part of uga's oxford program. graduate students provide editorial assistance to the award-winning online scholarly periodical, borrowers and lenders: the journal of shakespeare and appropriation . the lively graduate-student-run early modern union of scholars (emus) has organized a meeting of the southeastern renaissance conference, while students of earlier literatures participate in the georgia medievalists’ group. our graduate students have published in explicator , magistra , renaissance papers , the blackwell companion to early modern women's writing , and shakespeare bulletin . research opportunities abound for graduate students of early literatures at uga. the hargrett library acquired the book collection of the eminent early modern historian, a.l. rowse, and has a fair number of early modern printed books. students can also participate in the hargrett hours project, an ongoing study of the medieval items housed at the hargrett library. the library also has extensive holdings in rare and early maps, and in theatrical history, and the outstanding peabody collection. our electronic resources include literature online, early english books online, iter, the middle english compendium, project muse, jstor, and the world shakespeare bibliography, all accessible through galileo, the libraries’ database collection."
"unknown","the uga graduate program in english offers various means of developing expertise in theory and criticism alongside the study of literature and other areas of concentration, such as rhetoric and composition and humanities computing. while individual members of the faculty are affiliated with several different theories and disciplines, the department has particular strengths in feminism and gender studies, historicism, poststructuralism, theories of the construction of race, and theories of literary innovation. these strengths are reflected in our course offerings, such as recent seminars on specific critical movements (e.g. surrealism; media theory) and on individual theorists (e.g. benjamin; barthes). students may also study theory and criticism in the context of a body of literature, as in courses on “the early modern body,” “victorian femininity, nationhood, and the black atlantic,” “constructions of race in the american novel,” “museums, modernism, memory,” “urban modernity,” and “literature, media, and information in the nineteenth century.” students interested in pursuing theory and criticism may also take courses in other departments with strong offerings in theory (e.g. philosophy, comparative literature, and romance languages). the english department provides additional support for this area of study by sponsoring reading groups and by hosting lectures by eminent theorists including, in the last few years, johanna drucker, stanley fish, michael hardt, linda hutcheon, fredric jameson, and rei terada."

"unknown","digital humanities (dh) began a few decades ago with the application of computer tools to problems in literary stylistics, text processing, and text linguistics (including corpus linguistics, machine translation, and other computational problems). today, the field is dominated by mark-up languages--the \"ml\" in html, sgml, uml, and xml--the meta-language used to \"tag\" writing for machine processing (searching, display) and thus the crucial new dimension of textual information in the 21st century. content, however, is the real object of mark-up. mark-up language is also ly related to \"scripting,\" the specialized form of programming by means of which text operations are typically carried out on computers and web pages are made to be interactive. thus mark-up languages have become the means for an essentially new form of writing in which the medium and the message are more intimately and intricately interconnected than ever before, for literature and film, for language study, and for commercial applications. dh in english considers both the technical aspects of the application of computer technology to the humanities, and also the appreciation and assessment of its products. programming languages are typically taught in computer science and artificial intelligence, while mark up and humanities techniques like “writing for the web” are featured in dh. students begin their training with introduction to humanities computing, and may then follow their interests in a number of directions including interdisciplinary study. notable dh projects in the department include: the linguistic atlas project, www.lap.uga.edu < http://www.lap.uga.edu >, the site through which the atlas distributes text and audio materials related to american english, especially using gis tools dh students will have opportunities to participate in such research, in addition to opportunities for teaching experience. while all programs of study will necessarily include familiarity with at least one period of english literature, the flexibility of graduate requirements in english will allow students to follow their own interests in the selection of their coursework."
"unknown","english language studies (els) considers the history and present status of the english language. study of the english language is an important tool for the study of literature. to paraphrase cs lewis, in the older periods you know what you don't understand, but in more recent periods the apparent similarity of the words of the text to contemporary usage can mislead us. words like liberal and conservative, nature and world, require historical perspective before we can understand them fully in either the literature of historical periods or in the present day, when different authors compete to drive their meanings in particular directions. so, too, literature can be an important source of evidence for the study of the language across cultures, regions, nations, and time. els can help students negotiate style, both as readers and writers: stylistics embodies the essential connection between literature and els in grammar, discourse, and cognition. some courses, such as history of the english language, old english, and american english, treat the issue of language variation and change. other courses, such as english grammar, lexicography, esl error analysis, second language acquisition, style, and language variation and the linguistics of speech, treat specific topics and theories related to the english language. els is a descriptive discipline at georgia, considering what people have actually said and written in english as opposed to giving prescriptive advice about what people should say or write. while students can acquire training in syntax, phonology, and other sub-disciplines of linguistics through georgia's interdepartmental linguistics program, els students begin with history of the english language and develop the knowledge and skills appropriate for, at the ma level, further study in the language or a literary period or commercial jobs that demand control over language. at the doctoral level, students will compete for jobs as \"dr. language person\" in an english department where they can teach and do research in conjunction with the work of their colleagues in literature, creative writing, and digital humanities. els at georgia features internationally-prominent research in: language variation, especially through the linguistic atlas project, www.lap.uga.edu, the national center supported by the american dialect society for survey research on american english. lexicography, with faculty actively participating in english dictionaries such as the oxford english dictionary, and working on bilingual and learners' dictionaries, the dictionary as text, empirical research on dictionary use, and the history and theory of lexicography. corpus linguistics, the construction and analysis of large bodies of text by computer in the tradition of firth and sinclair, whether for literary (as in the study of style), commercial, or linguistic purposes. els students will have opportunities to participate in such research, in addition to the opportunities for teaching experience available to graduate students in english. programs of study will include familiarity with at least one period of english literature; the flexibility of requirements in english will allow students to follow their own interests in the selection of their coursework. the strengths of els at georgia naturally suggest, but do not require, some affiliation with digital humanities (see the description under ‘areas of study’)."

a combined average of “c-“ or 1.7 in english 1101 and 1102 will not satisfy the requirement for a combined average of “c” in the two courses. for more information on plus-minus grading, refer to the uga bulletin's q&a page on plus-minus grading policies. faq #9 is particularly relevant to the requirements of first-year writing. english 1102 shares the core goals, or learning outcomes, of english 1101, but includes as well other goals specific to the course. the content also varies: while english 1101 focuses on different varieties of non-fiction writing, english 1102 focuses on informational, analytical, and argumentative writing through literary texts in various genres; as in english 1101, research and critical thinking skills are also emphasized. there are different varieties of english 1102 classes and instructors design their own syllabi. in english 1102 students will learn to: students will write a minimum of three essays (1,000-1,500 words or longer) that count for at least 50% of the student’s final grade. in addition to writing papers and doing other work, all students will create a final electronic portfolio that counts as 30% of their final grade. primary required: first-year writing guide (digital version found on departmental website) text(s) must be chosen by course instructor. schilb and clifford. making literature matter , 6th edition. any standard college dictionary, such as: honors students have the option of substituting for english 1102 either english 1050h (composition and literature) or english 1060h (composition and multicultural literature). these courses have the same general goals as other first-year writing courses at the university of georgia, but each class is designed individually by the instructor, often around a special topic. special sections of english 1101 and 1102 are reserved for students who have a native language other than american english and who can benefit from an english for speakers of other languages (esol) emphasis in these classes. students enroll only with the permission of the department (pod), but the classes are not marked differently on their transcripts. the esol sections, like classes for native speakers, focus on writing academic argument in english 1101 and writing about literature in english 1102. first-year writing classes for esol offer non-native speakers opportunities for vocabulary development, for grammar practice, and for orientation to american styles of writing and organization. residents of the united states whose first language is not american english, as well as international students, may qualify for these classes. to determine your eligibility and to obtain a pod to register for the esol classes, contact the first-year writing program office (706-542-2128) or clare reid baeckeroot (clare.reid@uga.edu). in the regular, eight-week \"thru term\" of summer school, the first-year writing program offers english 1102e, a fully online, asynchronous course. students in 1102e meet all the standard fyw engl1102 requirements while completing a series of units (or \"modules\"). students work as a cohort between specified dates, but do not meet as a group during particular class times, either online or face-to-face. experienced instructors may design a special topics version of fyw that is approved in advance by the first-year writing committee. these courses often focus on topics related to the instructor’s research or scholarly interests, and the sections are marked by a special note in athena. english 1101s allows students to hone their developing writing skills through community service while still fulfilling the goals of a standard 1101. depending on the focus of the course, 1101s may involve field trips and out-of-class community service as well as community based writing projects. the ultimate goal of service-learning is to promote students' civic and academic learning while contributing to the public good."

"unknown","all students in a first-year writing course at uga produce a polished portfolio of their semester's work in the class. guidelines for writing the introductory reflective essay (rtf) portfolio grading rubric (rtf) the portfolio project helps you develop into a proficient writer by offering you multiple opportunities to practice and demonstrate to others your mastery of writing as an art. in this class, students will write a minimum of three graded papers plus other pieces of writing assigned by the teacher. part of each student’s course grade will also be determined by a portfolio of written work. the portfolio will count as 30% of your final grade and will replace the final examination as the culminating measure of your achievement in engl 1101 or engl 1102 this semester. for both students and teachers, portfolios offer many advantages over other forms of assessment. first-and probably most important, from the student’s point of view-writers gain more control over their writing and therefore over their grades. instead of demonstrating your skill in a single essay, the final examination, you will create, select, revise and polish different pieces for the portfolio throughout the semester. within boundaries established by the first-year writing program, you select the pieces to include in your portfolio; you will have opportunities to consult with your teacher and peers about the portfolio’s contents and to revise those pieces you choose to include; finally, you will have an opportunity to explain the merits of your portfolio as part of the assessment process. for the same reasons, teachers also like this method of evaluation: including portfolios in writing assessment allows them to focus on revision, on improvement, and on a process of collaboration among student, teacher, and peers. when you have completed this course, your portfolio will provide you with a readily accessible collection of your writing that can continually grow and change shape, reflecting your achievements in your academic major and, eventually, forming the basis of a professional portfolio that can accompany you as you leave the university of georgia for a further world of work or study. what is in the portfolio? as stated in the fyw handbook , students in the first-year writing program write a minimum of three graded papers. for your final assessment, you will compose and submit for evaluation an electronic portfolio that includes the following seven components: a biography of the portfolio author and, if you like, a picture of yourself or other image. the biography should provide a short introduction to you, the author of the portfolio. you may include a photo of yourself or an image that relates to ideas discussed in your portfolio. the goal of your biography should be to introduce yourself as a writer . the introductory reflective essay. the most important element in your portfolio, the introductory reflective essay (ire) (usually 750-1500 words) ties together all the exhibits in your portfolio; it helps you describe and reflect on your writing processes, with your exhibits providing the supporting evidence . two revised essays from the course. these pieces provide evidence of your best critical thinking, argumentative strategies, prose style, and editing skills. they represent your most “finished” pieces of writing. one revision exhibit that demonstrates your composing process and revision skills. for this exhibit, students typically present a portion of a paper (e.g., a paragraph or the thesis statement); and demonstrate the development of this piece of writing through several drafts. your task is to clearly show how your writing changed between drafts and to include explaining commentary on your revision process to readers. one peer review exhibit that demonstrates your work in reviewing or responding to the work of other writers. again, your task is to demonstrate the quality of your work and to explain your peer review process. one wild card submission. in the past, students have submitted journals, photos with captions, short stories, poems, letters, song lyrics, slideshow presentations, scans of drawings with comments, podcasts, and music files. some students create new exhibits especially to fit with their portfolio theme. in thinking about selecting or creating a wild card, consider how it fits into your overall portfolio rationale. while your instructor may have you turn in artifacts to elw for workshopping and peer review, you will turn in your final portfolio to elc under \"assignments.\" there are resources describing the process of submitting a portfolio in elc: a video and a text document. students can find these resources in their elc course under \"content\" --> \"fyw resources and info\""

"unknown","most university students will take english 1101 and 1102 during their first year at uga. however, some students will receive credit for these courses based on the following tests. complete information about placement is available on the \"credit from testing\" page on the registrar’s website . 1. the advanced placement test: students will need to wait for their test scores to be received by uga admissions and properly processed before moving forward with registration. students who earn a score of 3 or 4 on the national advanced language placement test in literature receive three hours of credit for english 1101; those who earn a score of 5 receive six hours of credit for english 1101 and 1102. all ap equivalencies are available on the registrar’s website . 2. the international baccalaureate (ib) program: students who earn a score of 4, 5, or 6 on the international baccalaureate exam at the high level (hl) in english receive three hours of credit for english 1101; those who earn a score of 7 on the international baccalaureate exam at the high level (hl) receive six hours of credit for english 1101 and 1102. students who earn a score of 5, 6, or 7 on the standard level (sl) test receive three hours of credit for english 1101. all ib equivalencies are available on the registrar’s website. 3. the departmental placement exam: beginning in fall 2003, students not placed by a national placement test will fall into two groups. students with an evidence based reading & writing (formerly known as satv) score of 590 and above or an act score of 26 or above will place automatically in engl 1101 and may register for that class without any further testing; if these students choose to do so, they may take the departmental placement exam voluntarily with an eye to exempting engl 1101 with three hours of credit. students with an ebrw (formerly known as satv) score of 580 or below are required to take the departmental placement exam before registering for a first-year writing class. specific information about the departmental english placement exam can be found at the testing services website's page on the exam. 4. incoming dual enrollment students who already have credit for first-year writing courses will not need to take the placement exam. please be sure that all official transcripts are sent and received by uga admissions for proper processing. 5. students with an sat score of 580 or below who have no other form of placement from a national test are required to take the english departmental placement exam before registering for any fyw courses. the departmental english placement test consists of two parts, mechanics and rhetoric. a score of 22 (part 1) and 20 (part 2) will place students in english 1102 and give them three hours of credit for english 1101. students whose test scores indicate that they might have trouble in english 1101 will write an essay to determine whether they will be advised to take english 1101 or an academic enhancement class. students should take the test at a first-year orientation session. those who miss the test at orientation may take it later at university testing services in clark howell hall. however, the test is not open to students who have taken or are currently enrolled in first-year writing here or elsewhere. for more information, please call (706) 542-3183 or visit the university testing service website . because writing skills develop slowly over time and because in-class activities are crucial to the discussion-based format of the class and its community-building mission, students’ regular attendance is important in first-year writing. it should be emphasized that when students miss class, regardless of whether the absence is excused or not, it is the responsibility of the student to keep up with the course. instructors are neither required nor expected to re-teach material covered in class to students who were absent. students who encounter a severe situation will only have those absences excused if the instructor receives notification of the situation from uga’s office of student care and outreach at the time of the situation. it is the responsibility of the student to have sco send a message to their instructor verifying the severity of the situation. beyond what is described above, the only other excused absences are those listed under uga policy 4.06, jury duty, military service, and religious observances. upon a student’s seventh un-excused absence (for classes that meet mwf) or upon the fifth absence (for mw and tth classes), students will begin to incur grade penalties. students incur no grade penalties for un-excused absences 1-6 (for classes that meet mwf) or un-excused absences 1-4 (for mw and tth classes). for each unexcused absence in excess of six (for mwf classes) or in excess of four (for mw and tth classes), three points will be deducted from the student’s final grade in the course. it is the instructor’s responsibility to judge work and assign grades. consequently, students with questions about final grades should first discuss those questions with their instructors. if the problem cannot be resolved in discussion, students may prepare a grade appeal in writing according to the new guidelines established by the franklin college bylaws, article v. you may view the franklin college bylaws on the college website . 1) students considering an appeal regarding a final grade in an fyw course should first read uga's guidance on the academic appeals process, available on the uga honesty site's grade appeals page . 2) after final grades have been recorded, the student should first appeal to the course instructor. the appeal to the instructor should contain a cover letter explaining the grounds for the appeal, and providing all relevant supporting documentation. 3) if, after appealing to the instructor, the student is not satisfied, they may appeal to the fyw program director, per department of english bylaws. in the appeal to the fyw program director the student should include: a) a cover letter explaining the grounds for the appeal; b) all relevant supporting documentation; c) copies of all appeal materials that were submitted to the course instructor in step 2. the fyw program director will not consider appeals received more than 30 days after final grades were recorded. the university assigns certain grades that are not computed in the grade point average. the incomplete (“i”) is one of these. it indicates that students have completed almost all of the course work satisfactorily but were unable to meet the full requirements of the course for reasons beyond their control. fyw teachers must obtain permission from the fyw office before assigning an \"i.\" when assigning incompletes, instructors will explain i n writing what students must do to finish the course. a copy of this document must be filed in the fyw office along with a signed grade change from. students who receive incompletes may have no longer than three semesters to complete all remaining work satisfactorily. instructors can require that students complete work in a shorter period of time. if an “i” is not removed after three terms (including summer), it changes to an “f.” incompletes are assigned sparingly and at the discretion of the instructor and the director of the first-year writing program when a small amount of essential work remains. an “i” is never assigned prior to mid-semester or for the purpose of allowing students to repeat courses. plus and minus grades are assigned only to a student’s final average for the course. for the final course grade, the numerical range for each plus/minus grade is as follows:"

"unknown","an area of emphasis is a group of four or more related courses within a major or coherent field of study. the english department introduced areas of emphasis to the major in the spring of 2009. our current areas of emphasis are: advanced studies in english , american literature , creative writing , eighteenth-century literature , english language studies , interdisciplinary renaissance studies , humanities computing , medieval literature , multicultural american literature , poetics , rhetoric and composition , and studies in the novel . we advise you to use the areas as suggestions for concentration in a particular genre or field of english studies. do you really love medieval literature or creative writing? by declaring an area of emphasis within your english major, you can now map out the best way to satisfy all your major requirements while still focusing ly on the fields you find most interesting. each area has a set of required courses as well as a selection of \"emphasis elective\" courses from which students may choose. this concentration prepares you for continuing your studies at the graduate and professional levels, whether in law, business, medical school or other programs. the track helps specifically with preparation for the gre subject test in english, emphasizing literary theory, advanced writing, and historical coverage. contact: dr. richard menke extensive study of american literature from its colonial origins to the present, including writers of all races, religions, and nationalities. contact: dr. cody marrs intense focus on creative writing classes as well as the study of classic and contemporary examples of creative literature. contact: professor aruni kashyap an area of emphasis in eighteenth-century british literature provides students a grounding in literary studies that can be applied to versatile fields, including law, literary studies, and business. the age witnessed the creation of the novel as a literary genre, the honing of ethics as a philosophical practice, the emergence of feminist discourse, and the rise of commercial culture and capitalism. the courses in this area will introduce you to the modern age (the age in which we still live) at its inception. a sister-concentration to linguistics. in this track, you will examine how english as a language functions and the interplay between language and literature. contact: dr. william kretzschmar this area of emphasis will bring out your latent english nerd. if you love all things renaissance -- history or the languages or even the fashions -- this cross-departmental concentration provides the ultimate foundation in renaissance (or early modern) studies. contact: dr. sujata iyengar this area of emphasis examines how english studies work in new media and the digital age. focuses on early literatures and languages from the british isles, including work in old english and middle welsh. contact: dr. jonathan evans. combines work in a variety of disciplines and examines the literary and artistic productions of peoples historically under-represented in english curricula. contact: dr. carmen comeaux poetry in theory and in practice from its ancient roots to the present day. contact: dr. susan rosenbaum this area of emphasis looks at what writing is and means. in this concentration you will examine how the way a thing is stated or formed affects/reflects meaning within the composition itself and the cultural circumstances that produced it as well. students are encouraged to take a 5th course from the following list: elan 4450: teaching writing in the secondary school or jour 3410: new writing and reporting or jour 3410h: news writing and reporting this area of emphasis examines what makes \"the novel\" unique within english studies, studying examples of the novel from the inception of the genre through contemporary explorations of what the medium can do. contact: dr. richard menke areas of emphasis are primarily intended as a student's self-advisement tools, ways of planning and tracking progress of study within the english major as a whole. as such, please note that because of budgetary and staffing constraints, we cannot guarantee that students who have declared an area of emphasis will be able to complete it in any given year. any student wishing to pursue an area of emphasis should see either the undergraduate coordinator or administrative coordinator for advisement at the start of the third year of study. please note the following: courses outside the english major may have lower division prerequisites. check the university bulletin to find out what prerequisites you may need in order to enroll in courses outside of the english major. also note: while many graduate level courses are accepted for various areas of emphasis, only 3 graduate level courses in total may be applied toward an undergraduate degree at the university of georgia. for all areas of emphasis, if students feel that a course they have taken for the english major should apply towards an area of emphasis, they may petition the undergraduate committee and appropriate area faculty for the course's inclusion within their area of emphasis work."
