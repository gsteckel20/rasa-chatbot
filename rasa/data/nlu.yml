    american studies, the institute of native american studies, latin american and
    caribbean studies institute, the institute for women''s studies, and the creative
    writing program.

    - faculty in the area also administer two list-serves - asail, the national list
    for the association of the study of american indian literature, and msis-l, a
    regional list for multicultural studies scholars - which both provide forums where
    our students can ask research questions, get assistance with problems in the classroom,
    stay abreast of current debates and publications, and find calls for papers for
    conferences and publications.

    - how does this relate to the gender profile of the faculty?

    - with five men gone in the past two years, gender parity in the faculty is finally

    the number of part-time instructors quadrupled, (3) 35% of part-time instructors
    live at or below the poverty line, and (4) no less than 61% of part-time instructors
    are women.

    - the most i can offer is a reflection on what it is we do, which is not correcting
    grammar and spelling (as so many people i’ve encountered on plane trips fear,
    when they find out i’m an english professor).

    - that was my blush-faced response to the professor—and to the class of undergraduates
    enrolled in arhi 3002, “greek art and architecture,” a course in which i, also
    a professor, was likewise a student.

    - i remember the slow-motioned moments before that painful admission: sitting
    in one of those uncomfortable desks, attentively viewing the slides, studiously
    taking notes, and hearing the professor call out: “dr.

    - but this was no new position for me—nor for the other faculty of the english
    department.

    - like many of our students, as faculty, we find ourselves fighting deadlines,
    finishing writing projects in the wee hours of the night, and dreading our work
    being “graded” or otherwise reviewed or evaluated.

    - but being a student is what faculty do for a profession.

    - i realize that most people think professors profess (that is, teach), but they
    also learn (that is, do research).

    - our faculty are constantly seeking out learning opportunities.

    - further, our faculty attended longer, educational “camps”: professor andrew
    zawacki, for example, spent time as a fellow at the atelier viceversa, atlas/
    collège international des traducteurs littéraires, arles, france, in a week-long
    intensive translation session with a dozen other french-to-english translators.

    - professor roxanne eberle participated in a neh institute on advanced topics
    in digital humanities at the university of pittsburgh, “make your edition: models
    and methods for digital textual scholarship.” the point i am making is this: our
    faculty are busying themselves with the business of learning.

    - further examples are detailed in this newsletter: for example, our faculty apply
    to participate in the study in a second discipline program and seek out various
    “fellow” programs available on campus, such as the service learning fellows, the
    online learning fellows, and the writing fellows.

    - a number of our faculty have been selected as fellows of the russell special
    collection libraries fellow program (see the feature on professor john lowe in
    this newsletter).

    - professor elizabeth kraft has researched materials like maps in the archives
    to introduce to her early eighteenth-century literature class, materials which
    nicely illustrate the themes and motifs in robinson crusoe.

    - other faculty members have also been selected for this program.

    - professor cynthia camp developed her medieval manuscript course so that students
    could work intensely on an advanced research group project on a single medieval
    book owned by uga, the hargrett hours.

    - professor camp articulates what she learned from this experience: “what i learned
    the most from the fellows program was how to think like a librarian: getting a
    professional''s perspective on how what processes they go through during acquisitions
    and cataloging, the logic behind the cataloguing system, and their vision of best
    practices during a library instructional visit.” professor nancee reeves similarly
    describes what she learned: “before my fellowship, i just turned my students loose
    in the archive library, with little direction, thinking the ‘joy of discovery’
    would take over.

    - for my students to learn, i first needed to learn, which was as much about how
    to use as archive library as the material in it.” my point, and i do have one,
    is this: our faculty are students as well; they know the pain of spending hours
    and hours composing work; they know the anxiety of being evaluated, the feeling
    of not knowing.

    - we were also able to acknowledge the excellence of a professor in our department.

    - in one of the many nominating letters received, one student characterized professor
    morales-franceschini’s pedagogical influence as such: he has fostered my growth
    as a student and as a thinker.

    - i have never had a professor who has emboldened me more to tackle difficult
    texts and to examine them critically.

    - i know i would not have been able to grow as much as a writer and a critical
    thinker if i did not have dr. morales-franceschini as a professor, encouraging
    me and inspiring me to aim higher, to write more ambitiously.

    - we appreciate the martha munn bedingfield endowment, which honors a long-time
    educator and allows us to acknowledge professor morales-franceschini’s expertise
    as a passionate teacher who encourages students to embrace the unknown, to tarry
    with the questions that challenge us.

    - this past summer, the department of english experienced such a loss when professor
    christy desmet died july 25, 2018, rendering that month a very cruel month, indeed.

    - fundamentally, professor desmet was fiercely protective of those under her care—and
    she cared for legions, including her beloved husband, david schiller, and all
    of her family, friends, colleagues, and students—her graduate students and every
    student in a first-year writing class.

    - the department of english prides itself on its contribution to writing instruction
    at the university of georgia, and professor desmet consistently did us proud.

    - kate arnold, 124 old college, uga, athens, ga 30602. as we ponder this loss,
    we simultaneously celebrate the achievements of all our faculty and students,
    who work tirelessly to accomplish much—as noted in this newsletter.

    - we also welcome to the department the very capable shaina patel, as the administrative
    specialist in the head’s office, and professor jason payton, as a recent faculty
    hire in early american literature (both featured in this newsletter).

    - we also celebrate the generous gifts of our donors, including professor emeritus
    hugh ruppersburg and tricia ruppersburg for their endowment to the undergraduate
    literary magazine, stillpoint, as well as announce a new scholarship for an exceptional
    graduate student in american literature, named for professor emeritus hubert mcalexander
    and retired professor pat mcalexander.

    - michelle ballif professor and head

    - and finally, sarah mayo was the recipient of the christy desmet graduate fellowship
    in british literature to 1900, in memoriam of professor desmet’s legacy in renaissance
    scholarship, as well as her ground-breaking work in shakespeare appropriation
    studies.

    - there is much to celebrate at this time, as the many and various accomplishments
    of our departmental faculty and students in this newsletter detail.

    - as we each nod our heads in affirmation, tickling the memory files of our days,
    months, years of what will become 2020, we are simultaneously, pleasantly tickled
    to learn that the joy and energy that motivates our faculty and students to pursue
    scholarship in english studies remains steadfast.

    - you’ll also see how the work that we do continues: books continue to be published,
    new faculty continue to join us, and—alas—much-respected faculty retire.

    - michelle ballif professor and head

    - although pandemic conditions necessitate our physical separation, we gather
    here virtually to celebrate accomplishments, to acknowledge the hard work that
    both students and faculty have undertaken in these past months to transition to
    online instruction, learning, and support, as well as to recognize the ways in
    which all have continued to produce smart and sophisticated work in troubled times.

    - we also want to acknowledge the retirement of two of our faculty, who have served
    the department for decades: professor elizabeth kraft and professor ron balthazor.

    - before you read on about the successes of our students and faculty, i want to
    express my appreciation for all of our faculty, our program coordinators, their
    administrative assistants, our support staff in the department—and, of course,
    the contributors to this newsletter.

    - there are many in our department who generously give of their time and talent,
    including—but not limited to—professor esra santesso and professor richard menke.

    - as they step back from these administrative demands, other faculty members have
    stepped up to assume these positions: professor roxanne eberle will become the
    new associate head and professor casie legette will serve as the undergraduate
    coordinator.

    - the department of english houses many faculty and staff who share a commitment
    of care, and we send not only a generous message of concern to our graduating
    students, but also a welcoming hand to our present and future students.

    - likewise, we are proud to recognize all in our department who teach our students:
    graduate teaching assistants, instructors, and faculty, who dedicate time and
    invest care in creating the conditions of success for our students—as ever, but
    especially during this past difficult year, when pedagogical means and ends were
    necessarily re-envisioned.

    - the department of english is committed to student success, as attested by our
    faculty’s accomplishments.

    - faculty do the same, already putting together fall courses while figuring out
    ways to get their research done during those same humid hours.

    - and, as always, some faculty are about to return to the temporal pattern that
    depends only on nature''s seasons and not uga''s.

    - it has been a pleasure overseeing and supporting the incredible work of our
    students, faculty, and staff.

    - this fall, we welcomed three terrific new faculty members: joshua cohen, david
    diamond, and david ingle.

    - in addition, we hired a new department head, dr. roland végső.

    - he currently serves as professor of english with a courtesy appointment in the
    department of communication studies at the university of nebraska-lincoln.

    - until 2022, dr. végső served as vice chair of the department of english at the
    university of nebraska-lincoln.

    - at the same time, we must say farewell to two of our most beloved faculty members,
    dr. john w. lowe and dr. jed rasula, both of whom have decided to retire.

    - since his appointment in 2012 as the barbara methvin professor of southern literature,
    dr. lowe has been an invaluable and affable member of the department, teaching
    numerous classes—and publishing landmark scholarship--on southern literature and
    culture.

    - dr. rasula, since his appointment in 2001 as the helen s. lanier distinguished
    professor of english, has transformed the study of modernism and produced a bounty
    of influential scholarship.

    - during this time, i served for several years as the graduate chair, vice chair,
    and the acting chair of the department of english—a series of experiences that
    helped instill in me a sense of the importance of administrative service.

    - as i was preparing to move our family from nebraska to georgia over the summer,
    i was eagerly looking forward to joining what appeared to be a vibrant creative
    and intellectual community of students and faculty.

    - as you will see in the rest of this newsletter, even in this short period of
    time our students, graduate students, and faculty members have accomplished a
    lot.

    - at the same time, we also hired another medievalist, dr. james sargan, who specializes
    in paleography, codicology, and the history of the book.

    - although not new to park hall, dr. rodrigo martini paula has joined us as an
    assistant professor specializing in anglophone modernism, media studies, and animal
    studies.

    - finally, we hired jami mays as our new front office assistant who also provides
    support to the creative writing program.

    - as chair of the british women writers association, she brought the group’s conference
    to athens twice.

    - however, his memory will live on in park hall, fueled by his kindness, his scholarship,
    and a gift from june c. lowe, professor lowe’s widow.

    - “the fellowship and the support fund are both specifically designed to help
    graduate students who work in the fields that professor lowe himself championed
    throughout his long and distinguished career,” said roland végső, the head of
    the english department.

    - dear colleagues, students, alumni, and friends of english, another year has
    passed, and the department of english continues to be the source of exciting new
    work in all the fields of our discipline that our faculty and students are involved
    with.

    - under rebecca hallman martini’s excellent leadership, the willis center for
    writing continues to offer support to all students, faculty, and staff on a wide
    variety of writing-related projects.

    - professor lowe was barbara methvin professor of english specializing in southern
    and multiethnic literatures.

    - we are now delighted to announce that with a generous gift from june c. lowe,
    professor lowe’s widow, we will be able to launch the john wharton lowe graduate
    fellowship and the john wharton lowe graduate support fund.

    - both the fellowship and the support fund are designed to provide support to
    graduate students who work in the fields that were important for professor lowe
    during his distinguished career.

    - if you are yourself an enthusiast of southern and multiethnic literatures or
    if you have been lucky enough to personally benefit from professor’s lowe’s infinite
    spirit of generosity, please consider donating to the john wharton lowe, iii doctoral
    fellowship in american, southern american or multicultural american or to the

    the second way is to demonstrate proficiency (a higher level of language fluency)
    in one foreign language; the third way is to demonstrate reading knowledge of
    one foreign language and competence in specified research skills.

    - the student''s advisory committee must approve the language or languages offered,
    and the graduate committee must approve any proposed set of research skills (such
    a plan of study should involve substantial study taken at the graduate level outside
    the english department).

    committee.

    - an oral portion of the exam provides time to follow up on the written component,
    as well as to discuss the items on the reading list.

    - in addition, all students prepare a "project description," which is a preliminary
    discussion on the students'' dissertation topic.

    - this is an 8-10 page document, with an accompanying annotated bibliography.

    - the project description defines a research question that is worth pursuing and
    demonstrates the student''s ability to answer it.

    - our students are accomplished poets, fiction writers, essayists, translators,
    and interdisciplinary artists who are ready to move beyond the studio focus of
    the mfa to a more intensive program of literary study.

    - prior to beginning their third year, students prepare reading lists for comprehensive
    exams in three academic research fields of their choosing.

    - every cwp student chooses “forms and craft” as one of their exam areas.

    - this reading list serves as a research field unique to each writer’s approach
    to their particular genre.

    - some of the “forms and craft” lists designed recently by cwp students include,
    “the midwestern novel”; “occult and visionary poetics”; “history of surrealism”;
    “monstrosity in epic poetry”; and “literary translation: theory and practice.”
    the two other exam fields should complement and expand the student’s areas of
    expertise beyond craft in order to broaden their historical and theoretical understanding
    of literature.

    - during the third year students read in preparation for written and oral exams.

    - each written exam takes the form of a twenty-page written exhibit in which the
    student answers a directive question formulated in conjunction with the exam area’s
    director.

    - this exhibit should demonstrate the student’s grasp of the field as a whole
    and serves as a demonstration of their ability to teach in this area at the undergraduate
    level.

    - once the student has passed written exams, they are admitted to an oral exam
    overseen by the exam committee as a whole.

    - during their fourth and fifth years cwp students complete a creative dissertation
    with a critical introduction.

    - the dissertation typically is a full-length work in a single genre—a work of
    fiction, creative non-fiction, or poetry.

    - in the past students have used the introduction as a scholarly analysis of the
    state of the genre, a critical meditation on process informed by literary history,
    or a theoretical tracing of literary influence.

    - students may submit up to three poems for consideration.

    - information on how to enter the contest will be circulated through the english
    department''s undergraduate listserv in february.

    - he has been writer-in-residence at the james merrill house in stonington, conn.,
    a huntington fellow, and a whiting fellow.

    - over the last two decades, my research has been driven by a set of interrelated
    theoretical questions as i explored a wide range of historical and cultural phenomena.

    - while the pursuit of these fundamental questions has guided me through several
    related academic fields (modernist studies, comparative literature, american studies,
    cold war studies, continental philosophy, and translation theory), the guiding
    light in these inquiries has always been the same concern with the political functions
    of literature amidst the permanent crises of modernity.

    - i am currently in the process of exploring some new directions in my research
    as i have been doing more and more work in the fields of media philosophy and
    new media studies.

    - my first book, the naked communist (fordham up, 2012), explores the ways literature
    participated in the constitution of the global imaginaries of early-cold war us
    mainstream culture in the 1950s.

    - by dividing the globe into three separate “worlds,” this cultural imaginary
    tried to contain a historical crisis that, for the first time in the history of
    the west, threatened the entire globe with the real possibility of human extinction.

    - i tried to demonstrate that in this historical context the idea of “modernism”
    was reconfigured to provide an ideological justification for a specific type of
    post-colonial imperialism whose long-term effects are still detectable today.

    - the conclusions of this book set me on a broader research agenda that i am currently
    exploring in my current work.

    - my second monograph, worldlessness after heidegger (edinburgh up, 2020), examines
    the way the concept of “worldlessness” has emerged in 20 th -century continental
    philosophy as the standard name for the epochal catastrophe that supposedly threatens
    us all with the loss of our humanity.

    - according to this intellectual tradition, technological development, imperialism,
    globalization, the generalization of war-like conditions over the globe, and the
    looming threat of ecological disaster have created a historical situation in which
    humanity is simultaneously ever more technologically connected and is increasingly
    incapable of constructing a shared common “world.” this lost sense of a shared
    community, then, supposedly explains the rise of authoritarian political tendencies
    today.

    - the book argues that some of the most influential intellectual innovations of
    the 20 th century like phenomenology, psychoanalysis, and deconstruction should
    be seen as fundamentally political responses to this historical situation and
    calls for affirmative definitions of “worldlessness.” in addition to traditional
    forms of academic literary and cultural criticism, i am also deeply committed
    to editing and translation.

    - i got involved with editing while i was still a graduate student at suny/buffalo.

    - i have always considered these opportunities to have been foundational experiences
    of my education as they showed me the force and necessity of creating intellectual
    communities around pressing contemporary questions.

    - the book series, provocations , that i co-edit with marco abel for the university
    of nebraska press was conceived in the same spirit as it publishes short polemical
    interventions into contemporary academic debates.

    - my theoretical interest in translation has always been rooted in the practice
    of translation, which has been my constant preoccupations for the entirety of
    my academic career.

    - since it is impossible to separate the theory from the actual experience of
    translation, over the years i have also specialized in the translation of continental
    philosophy and critical theory.

    - i am the translator and co-translator of three books: rodolphe gasché’s georges
    bataille: phenomenology and phantasmatology (stanford university press, 2012),
    peter szendy’s all ears: the aesthetics of espionage (fordham university press,
    2017), and fethi benslama’s thinking revolution: writings on insubmission (co-translated
    with nathan gorelick, forthcoming from bloomsbury).

    - other publications

    - j. d. sargan (he/him) specializes in medieval english literature, paleography,
    codicology, and the history of the book.

    - he is the co-editor of the routledge handbook to the history of the book in
    medieval western europe, 650–1550 (forthcoming 2025) and of the medieval volume
    of a cultural history of trans lives (forthcoming 2027).

    - dr sargan''s research occupies three overlapping spheres.

    - his first book project, reading early middle english books , is invested the
    multiplicity of partial literacies exhibited by readers of manuscripts from 1066–1300.

    - in it he uses critical approaches to non-verbal evidence—marks, dirt, and the
    haptics of binding—to show that reading was a social act that extended the written
    word to those far beyond the limits of traditional considerations of literacy.

    - his interest in the haptics and handling of books lead to dr sargan’s work investigating
    binding structures using scientific imaging.

    - collaborations on this research have produced proof on concept studies on the
    use of micro-ct in researching no longer extant binding structures (published
    in digital philology , 2022); the use of such imaging for conservation planning
    and decision making (in preparation, care and conservation of manuscripts ); and
    the visualization of medieval fragments reused in the production of early modern
    bindings.

    - finally, both of these research areas have been a prompt to critical thinking
    about methodology.

    - dr sargan’s second book project, trans histories of the medieval book: experiments
    in bibliography (forthcoming 2025), take a theoretical approach to traditional
    methods in the study of manuscripts, assessing their historical roots in imperialist
    intellectual traditions and proposes an alternative approach grounded in queer
    and trans liberation.

    - an initial trial of this approach can be found in “what could a trans book history
    look like?

    - toward trans codicology”, criticism 64.3-4 (2023).

    - his newest scholarly project, tenacious beauty: theses on militancy as an aesthetic,
    looks to militancy not in terms of idealistic folly or violent menace inasmuch
    as eros, beauty, and the sublime.

    - with an eye for the embodied rhetoric, iconography, and aesthetic "tactics"
    of the young lords, black panthers and cuban barbudos , it asks what about militancy
    seduces and empowers, not just scandalizes or terrifies.

    as an aesthetic, namely the begetting body, decolonial love, sovereign performativity,
    the salvific sublime, and restorative mimicry.

    phenomenon.

    of 38 members of the dakota tribe in mankato, minn., on dec. 26, 1862—the largest
    mass execution in american history—under the order of abraham lincoln.

    - the narrative is set primarily in the bellevue place sanitarium in batavia,
    ill., in 1875 and features three characters: mary todd lincoln, whom her son robert
    had institutionalized there earlier that year; savage indian, a personification
    of the executed dakotas and their tribe; and the rope, an image of the u.s.’s
    tools of execution.

    - basing their interactions on mary’s reported delusions of an indian spirit who
    mauls her nightly, howe choreographs an intimate pas de deux between mary, who
    excoriates her husband and family for their neglect, and the savage indian, a
    symbol of national guilt and injustice.” dr. zurawski’s latest work is the tiniest
    muzzle sings songs of freedom , forthcoming from wave books .

    - from wave books: “taking readers from suburban carports to wintry russian novels,
    from summer tomato gardens to the sublime interiors of presleep thoughts, magdalena
    zurawski’s poems anchor the complexities of our interconnected world in the singularity
    of the human experience.

    - balancing artistic experimentation with earnest expression, achingly real detail
    with dazzling prismatic abstraction, humor with frustration, light with dark,
    she offers a book of great human depth that is to be carried around, opened to
    anywhere, and encountered.”

    - her interests include poetics, excerpting, anthologies, education, radical politics,
    periodical culture, and book history.

    - she is currently at work on a book manuscript on the uses of poetry in educational

    - in 2018, she edited a special issue of nineteenth century studies , on "reassembly."

    - her first book, remaking romanticism: the radical politics of the excerpt (palgrave

    chronology in the service of political change.

    with my father.

    me.

    - flash-forward forty-six years and this brief moment in time informs my research
    agenda—depictions of race and ethnicity in science fiction.

    titled "beyond afrofuturism," fifteen book chapters, twenty-one peer-reviewed
    articles and essays, three review essays, sixteen published book reviews, three
    encyclopedia entries, and nineteen media appearances on the subjects of race and
    racism in science fiction.

    - my eighth has been submitted for review at a university press in addition to
    a forthcoming book chapter and one more commissioned.

    - all these amazing things have happened because of a love of reading instilled

    on with my scholarship.

    - dr. david mark diamond teaches and writes about eighteenth-century british literature
    and the early black atlantic, with particular emphasis on the role that religion
    plays in the formation of imperial global imaginaries.

    - his current research examines literary responses to secularization, or the process
    by which christian belief came unbound from singular doctrinal orthodoxy and this
    newly liberalized religion was grafted more and more fully onto the european ambition
    of racialized planetary domination.

    - in his first book, reading character after calvin: secularization, empire, and
    the 18th-century novel (university of virginia press, 2024), diamond revises and
    relates the histories of secularization, imperial race-making, and novelistic
    character.

    - he argues that the surprising persistence and complexity of two-dimensional
    characterization in novels from the restoration to the romantic era index secularism’s
    disciplinary valence.

    - flesh and spirit in need of domestication—errant beliefs and forms of life—manifest
    through, for example, the instability of allegorical personification or the physiognomic
    language of gothic faces.

    - in simultaneity with spiritual excess or insufficiency, corporeal differences
    of sex and race are made to appear, and the intensifying, biopoliticized violence
    of empire made to appear justified.

    - diamond''s current book project, tentatively entitled "before world religions:
    the politics of pluralism in eighteenth-century literature," reconstructs the
    literary pre-history of a core principle of modern liberal thought: pluralism.

    - "before world religions" surveys eighteenth-century literary explorations of
    religious coexistence, c entering perspectives that stuart hall and ashley cohen
    have described as “black british,” an identity category that is inclusive of diasporan
    african and south asian writers and thus bridges two zones of empire.

    - charles ignatius sancho, olaudah equiano, and sake dean mahomet, among other
    writers, model ways of thinking about differences of faith that neither ratify
    nor fully escape the logics of christian imperialism.

    - they exemplify a regime still in formation, neither truly open nor constricted
    into the discipline it would become.

    - eighteenth-century authors, therefore, offer not only a snapshot of political
    modernity as it was taking shape but also an opportunity to imagine counterfactual
    trajectories, dispositions of self and social arrangements that weren''t realized
    in the moment but may be worth recuperating today.

    - her interests include native and indigenous literatures, performance studies,
    film, and indigeneity.

    - howe''s monograph savage conversations, 2019, coffee house press , set in 1875,
    is the story of mary todd lincoln and a savage indian ghost that mary claimed
    was torturing her nightly.

    - as a result of her ravings, mary was tried by an illinois court and confined
    to an insane asylum at batavia, illinois.

    - recent performances of savage conversations with actors marla carlson, (uga
    theater) nic billey, (choctaw) and nora cole were performed on govenors island,
    nyc in september 2022. howe and irish playwright colm summers'' play the keening
    is set to be performed in november 2022 at the irish cultural centre in nyc.

    - the play set in indian territory, and famine ireland, and present-day new york.

    - the three act play begins with aoife, mourning the death of another child from

    is presiding officer for the international society for the history of lexicography
    and lexicology ( ishll website) , and, book series co-editor, world histories
    of lexicography and lexicology ; he has research interests in literary lexicography
    and history of semantics and philosophical grammars , especially as these linguistically-based
    studies raise questions concerning the dictionary as text, the literariness of
    literary theory, and the theory and practice of bibliography ; the preceding is
    informed largely by his work on constructed languages and lexicons of the 17th
    century, classification systems, and other methods of transmitting and representing
    words and concepts across space and time.

    - dr. dolezal''s most recent edited volume, broadening perspectives in the history

    - , has been published in a collection entitled historical dictionaries in their
    paratextual contexts (roderick mcconchie; jukka tyrkkö, editors.

    - although often stereotyped as the “nation’s other,” the south has participated
    in every military conflict since the civil war, and like the nation, has been
    transformed by the rise of cities, multinational corporations, and webbed systems
    of transportation and communication.

    - increasingly, it has interacted - as it always has - with the circumcaribbean,
    through trade, political ruptures and treaties, cultural exchanges, and mutual
    cultural influences, particularly music, art, and dance.

    - as a crucial component of southern culture, southern literature has mapped histories
    of native americans, diasporic africans, colonization, slavery, immigration, agriculture,
    industrialization, and increasingly, urbanization.

    - while the study of southern cultures once was concentrated in literature and
    history, it has expanded to include food studies, climate studies, race and gender
    studies, ethnic studies (especially african american and native studies), queer
    studies, and popular culture, which includes film, television, graphic works,
    music, and digital media.

    - these developments have been absorbed by the “new southern studies,” which has
    generated many new approaches to the u.s. south and its larger configurations
    with the circumcaribbean, the hemisphere, and the atlantic world.

    - critics such as richard gray, patricia yaeger, martyn bone, harriet pollack,
    thadious davis, jose limón, trudier harris, keith cartwright, anna brickhouse,
    gary richards and susan donaldson have put a new slant on the field of southern
    literature.

    - also, the configuration of the u.s. south with the caribbean has brought in
    theoretical perspectives from figures such as édouard glissant, j. michael dash,
    valérie loichot, deborah cohn, and vincent pérez.

    - historians such as david blight, marcus rediker, rebecca j. scott, matthew guterl,
    nell painter, michael trouillot, daniel heath justice, chadwick allen, and rod
    ferguson and others have reshaped our concepts of southern and circumcaribbean
    history.

    - many uga students hail from the south, so this focus on its cultural history
    and heritage comprises a valuable and magnetic mirror, one that reflects the confluences,
    conflicts, and inheritance of a polyglot people.

    - this southern studies concentration thereby offers a valuable foundation for
    negotiations with our nation’s present and futures.

    - as timothy brennan argues, postcolonial studies brings together “globalizing
    features of world history and human societies” and “colonial practices and anticolonial
    challenges”.

    - the interdisciplinary approach embraced by postcolonial studies provides a variety
    of academic tools and perspectives to study the social, cultural, and psychological
    aftermath of colonialism and the identity crisis generated in the wake of decolonization.

    - independence efforts in the indian subcontinent following the world war ii as
    well as the grassroots movements targeting colonial regimes in northern africa
    have paved the way towards a rethinking of the power dynamics by challenging eurocentric
    and orientalist ways of defining the other.

    - an important aspect of this critical approach is to scrutinize the dehumanization
    and exploitation of the native under colonial rule (albert memmi, aime cesaire),
    the formation of national consciousness (bill ashcroft et al.

    - ), and the role of violence in establishing sovereign states as well as sovereign
    individuals (fanon).

    - ), it helps evaluate the shifting significations of “home”—for those who cross
    borders to abandon their homes of origin to adopt new ones, as well as those who
    remain in their “natural” homes only to witness significant transformations around
    them.

    - as we enter the 21st century, postcolonial literature and theory helps reinvigorate
    recent debates on “world” and “global” literatures, neocolonialism, neoliberalism,
    decoloniliaty with an eye toward redefining humanism and secularism in new contexts.

    - her fields of expertise include african american literature and culture, transatlantic
    studies, and constructions of race and gender.

    / an apocalypse and american purgatory - july 10, 2024 "holly haworth''s the way
    the moon shares its being with the moon itself, and the poems know what the moon
    knows: that the light we shine is never ours alone.

    - each new line break, breath, and page takes me further into the truth that even
    the smallest of us, and the most hurting, carry the whole earth within.

    - or, as the poet writes, ''love is not born once but must / give birth to itself
    again & again.''

    - this astonishing debut lives in my heart next to louise glück''s the wild iris
    and cd wright''s casting deep shade.

    - haworth has given us transformation, a true work of art."

    - review by: g.c.

    - waldrep, author of the earliest witnesses - july 10, 2024 "holly haworth''s
    collection is a gorgeous recital of ''clear-throated singing,'' a hymn to and
    for a creation that has not yet (despite humankind''s best intentions) been divested
    of the numinous.

    - what does one do when a place becomes ''everything i needed?''

    - one needs more, and better; differently, and in present tense.

    - the sumptuous poems record the fulfillment and enlargement of a desire that
    is both satiated by and reflected urgently in the observed world, the all that
    is not-i, the not-self.

    - their opulence gleams and rings in the ''cast-iron night.''"

    - review by: anne haven mcdonnell, author of breath on a coal and recipient of
    a 2023 nea literature fellowship in creative writing - july 10, 2024 "in holly
    haworth''s debut book of poems, the speaker whispers, ''i am abandoned to the
    land.''

    - and this quiet abandonment allows multitudes of beings of the blue ridge mountains
    to shimmer and speak.

    - i trust haworth''s earned bodily intimacy, with her ''basketsful of nettle /
    armsful of fennel,'' the lived knowing, the sorrowful and ecstatic inside these
    poems.

    - i want to read these lyric spells by candlelight, by moonlight: slip from human
    habit and disperse into this enchanted, tangled wild place."

    - review by: abraham smith, author of insomniac sentinel and dear weirdo - july
    10, 2024 "the way the moon spellbinds.

    - the poems yearn.

    - the poems see.

    - together we wander with haworth over her homeland loams.

    - somewhere dorothy wordsworth keeps time with an apple-switch while dock boggs
    sings like a coyote full of rabbit and rain.

    - i had to sit while reading these poems because they floored me.

    - i had to stand and do a little dance because haworth''s music would not let
    my knees keep still.

    - such is the fecund gambol you are in for, dear reader.

    - and i have a mind to plant each and all of her heirloom words.

    - and i''ll be hoping for a rhubarb the size of a cathedral.

    - let''s all meet there soon.

    the elemental intimacy of these poems."

    licks you clean again.’ but the world is too rancid with roadkill and rot, gristle
    and bone of our earthly abattoir, to perform such ablutions.

    - instead, the south and its family anarchies are a visceral mirror to the afterlife
    inside this one, as the speaker becomes an uncanny daphne, her infirm body overrun
    by kudzu and witchcraft, venom and clay.

    fencing), and i occasionally bounce ideas off of game studies to see what sticks.

    - in short, i find myself frequently thinking about reading and writing as a player,
    looking to see what i can do with them,” howard said.

    - the professional field of academia is nothing new to howard.

    - his mother and two of his three siblings are teachers, while his father works
    as a trainer.

    - their influence has been a source of inspiration.

    - “uga has more to explore than i''m used to: more coffee shops, more sections
    in its libraries, more quiet buildings and reading spots, more lunch destinations.

    - that is not to mention the many lovely people - students, colleagues - i''ve
    met and continue to meet,” he said.

    - the most powerful part, overall, of academia and english for howard is the human
    connection, in fact.

    - “what i value the most in academia is the sense of purpose centered on collaborative,
    lifelong learning.

    - i knew that, if i could center my work on that, i could keep doing it for a
    long, long time.”

    - if you have ever taken a yoga class, you may have heard an instructor use the
    term “find your edge,” referring to the place where comfort meets discomfort.

    - for dr. elizabeth davis and a group of eleven intrepid undergraduates, that
    phrase captures the essence of their experience in a new domestic field study
    program, “writing & community at the georgia coast.” developed by dr. davis in
    collaboration with uga’s marine extension unit, and with support from a 2023 domestic
    field study fellowship and from the willson center’s culture & community partnership
    with the penn center historic district, the program was designed to create an
    immersive learning experience researching and writing in and for coastal communities.

    - while she was in her element developing new academic classes and projects, designing
    and implementing a study away program pushed davis to her edge.

    - budgets, travel logistics, health and safety planning, and student recruitment
    – the nuts and bolts of creating a study away program were complicated and, at
    times, frustrating.

    - but the work came to fruition and the new program began enrolling students for
    maymester 2024. the class met on campus for the first four days of the term, reading
    articles and books on the history of the global atlantic, coastal geography and
    ecology, and oyster aquaculture.

    - before they knew it, the time had come to depart athens and they set off, arriving
    at st. helena island, sc for their penn center residency.

    - davis was excited to observe her students making themselves at home in the charming
    dormitories there, playing cards, sharing favorite music and movies, and relaxing
    at the dock after each busy day’s activities.

    - again, though, davis and her students were pushed from their comfort zones as
    they absorbed history they had not been taught in school and learned about the
    ecological and economic challenges that threaten the future of sea island communities.

    - but this foundation proved critical as the group moved on to their next destinations
    to learn more about the work that happens in uga facilities like the marine education
    center and shellfish research lab on skidaway island, the uga marine institute
    on sapelo island, and the marex field station in brunswick.

    - students in the program challenged themselves to do new things: piloting a research
    vessel in the estuaries, recording data on the marine life hauled up in trawl
    nets, cooking meals, lugging gear, picking crab and heading shrimp, getting muddy
    in the salt marsh, and listening intently to community members’ stories of the
    past and concerns for the future.

    - and all the while, they wrote - their own stories inspired by their travels,
    and stories of people and seafood that illuminate marex’s critical work supporting
    coastal communities.

    - the opportunity to get outside the comfort of park hall proved invaluable.

    - gruszczinski sums it up well: “writing and community on the ga coast reminded
    me how much literature and storytelling can genuinely have an impact.

    - a fter a year and a half of being a student in the english department, i am
    embarrassed to admit that i sometimes still get lost in park hall.

    - with its well-worn staircases and confusing floorplan, i know i am not the only
    one.

    - park hall certainly isn’t the flashiest or most sensical building, but there
    is a reason to its madness.

    - its history explains some of its mystery.

    - part of why park hall is so weird is partly due to its age.

    - as a part of president franklin delano roosevelt’s new deal, the public works
    administration constructed park hall in 1939. park hall—the most up-to-date building
    at the time—was part of a uga expansion plan that also included the construction
    of leconte hall and baldwin hall.

    - before it was home to the english department, park hall contained the department
    of physics.

    - during uga’s growth spurt in the 1960s, the university planned to add an annex
    to park hall to provide additional space and new technology for its students and
    teachers.

    - the annex was completed in 1970 and also provided women’s restrooms—that’s why
    they’re all on one side of the building!

    - now, park hall houses both the english and classics departments.

    - in 1946, the building was named after the late robert emory park, who served
    as the english department head from 1900-1942 (yes, you read that correctly!).

    - but information about robert park is scant.

    - even his great-grandson, richard stephen (steve) monday, has found difficulty
    in learning about his ancestor.

    - thankfully, a 1957 article from the georgia review provides some insight into
    the park hall namesake: robert emory park was born to emma bailey and james fletcher
    park in tuskegee on 11 december, 1868. he enrolled in west point military academia
    in 1888, but resigned after eighteen months due to an injury.

    - when he returned home, he attended the university of alabama, where he received
    a.b.

    - before he arrived at uga in 1900, park taught at gainsville high schools and
    married mary belle whelchel, who belonged to a prominent north georgia family.

    - in addition to his forty-year tenure as head of the english department, park
    studied at oxford university for a year, travelled in europe, and received an
    honorary doctorate from ua.

    - he was also a member of the methodist church, the democratic party, and several
    fraternities.

    - the article speaks highly of robert e. park--describing his character as accomplished
    and disciplined, but gentle-natured.

    - he had a warm personality and was dedicated to his students’ education and well-being.

    - like most of his colleagues, he gave little or no time to the composition of
    scholarly learned journals; he gave his time instead to his reading and to his
    students” sources: rebecca hopper and akela reason.

    - not to mention the weather, perfect as usual in early may in athens.

    - thank you, coach bauerle, for inspiring our graduating class this year!

    - this year we have much to celebrate.

    - this year it was cody marrs.

    - his poetry collection, let’s let that are not yet: inferno was published as
    a winner of the national poetry series and on the scholarly front, his book who
    can afford to improvise?

    - james baldwin, black music, and the listeners came out almost at the same time.

    - as returning director of the creative writing program, ed’s bifocal and multilateral
    interests and accomplishments are indicative of the ingredients that make our
    doctoral program in creative writing one of the top in the nation.

    - with the decline of state funding for public universities in georgia and across
    the country, the role played by the munificence of benefactors is more urgent—and
    appreciated—than ever.

    - mary anne hale has created the paul douglas (doug) hale learning enhancement
    fund in memory of her husband.

    - a loyal and consistent donor, doug stayed in touch with his alma mater.

    - he was a raconteur who would have made mark twain proud, and he possessed an
    outsized curiosity about everything under the sun.

    - it is always a pleasure to meet veterans of park hall, but doug was one of a
    kind.

    - jed rasula department head photo credit: dr. sara steger

    - this year has seen a wave of centenary celebrations commemorating the avant-garde
    movement known as dada.

    - one of the dadaists accused art of being “a large-scale swindle.” the swindle
    was not financial, but ethical.

    - “the dadaist considers it necessary to come out against art, because he has
    seen through its fraud as a moral safety valve.” accordingly, “dada is forever
    the enemy of that comfortable sunday art which is supposed to uplift man by reminding
    him of agreeable moments.” this sounds severe, yet it’s demonstrably the case
    that dada won (“dada siegt” was a common rallying cry: dada triumphs), at least
    in the art world.

    - in literature it seems different, until we remind ourselves that we don’t even
    need to make a special effort to stock our syllabuses with texts that caper and
    taunt, disoblige, harass, and generally refrain from “uplift.” after the harrowing
    misadventures chronicled in ralph ellison’s invisible man, the novel ends with
    the unsettling insinuation by its african american protagonist: “on the lower
    frequencies, i speak for you.” or consider virginia woolf’s wry observation in
    a room of one’s own: “women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses
    possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice
    its natural size.” these statements are a constant reminder of the extravagant
    potentiality of literature.

    - “i cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation of a true expression,”
    quipped henry david thoreau in walden, a book rife with semantic shenanigans.

    - no wonder (one might be tempted to observe) people are wary of literature and
    art, both of which flamboyantly refuse to comply with heartfelt sentiments and
    good taste.

    - we are now deep into one of those periodically recurring features of american
    life in which there’s a seismic shift in focus by students and their families.

    - in its aggregate form, this is known as a flight from the humanities.

    - what this pattern reveals is that education (besides being, well, education)
    is a bet, a wager on the future.

    - do you put your chips on the roulette wheel options of english, or engineering,
    studio art, animal husbandry, pharmacy?

    - these contested numbers reflect well on our department.

    - it means we deliver the goods, as the saying has it.

    - but what are the goods?

    - in the old-timey school formula—reading, writing, and ’rithmetic—we deliver
    two of the three.

    - but it’s not that simple.

    - there’s also a lot of history that comes into play (after all, history is not
    exclusive to the history department any more than written english is exclusive
    to us).

    - and there’s psychology, and sociology, and philosophy, and … but why enumerate,
    when the fact is that literature encompasses anything and everything?

    - one thing that literature definitely does not do is pander to your own views
    and biases.

    - literature steers a wide berth around what’s been called “homophily,” described
    as “a tendency to listen to and associate with people like yourself, and to exclude
    outsiders.” this is from an article on the viral agency of social networks, “
    war goes viral: how social media is being weaponized ” by emerson t. brooking
    and p. w. singer (in the november 2016 issue of the atlantic).

    - i wouldn’t normally have listed grief counseling among the services we provide,
    but i’m not surprised that it has come to that.

    - what this phenomenon reflects is the fact that in english classes students are
    being constantly exposed to the light and the dark of human endeavor, the sad
    and the happy, viciousness and beneficence, pluck and luck.

    - there is no preordained response to the books we read, but there’s almost always
    a response, because stories and novels, poems and plays make a claim on us.

    - collectively, it’s called literature not because it has “passed the test of
    time” but because it doesn’t claim attention as merchandise.

    - we don’t read what we read because it’s popular (moby-dick was such a flop it
    effectively ended melville’s career as a writer, but many would now list it as
    their favorite book, including me).

    - we read these things because they provide access to another world that is strangely
    like this world yet, like alice going into wonderland, once we’re inside we’re
    likely to find ourselves bemused, horrified, delighted, indifferent, but always
    learning.

    - the appetite for learning is what all the humanities provide.

    - that can put a real damper on the learning process, which then feels like studying
    up for a driver’s license.

    - the humanities give us something altogether different, and i’d put it this way:
    you can never pass the test.

    - and that’s because there’s no test; there’s just life—and learning, with all
    its pleasures, irritants, and absorbing challenges.

    - i’ll end with a haunting provocation from robert frost.

    - but here’s where it gets interesting.

    - “i’ve been thinking lately that politics is an extravagance,” he suggests, “an
    extravagance about grievances.

    - and poetry is an extravagance about grief.

    - and grievances are something that can be remedied, and griefs are irremediable,
    you know.

    - once again, spring has come — and gone already, having arrived as early as january.

    - “that’s true,” i replied.

    - of eighty-three classes, only eight had gender parity, while twenty-nine had
    a ratio of 10 to 1 (female to male).

    - retirements tell the story.

    - this year we bade farewell to doug anderson, simon gatrell, and fred dolezal,
    who were preceded in retirement last year by hugh ruppersburg and charlie doyle.

    - in fact, the only woman who has retired in the past eight years was the late
    judith ortiz cofer.

    - and so it is fitting that the next department head will be michelle ballif,
    who will succeed me in august.

    - but gender disparity in english means there’s disparity elsewhere, and this
    has the potential to replicate old stereotypes in worrisome ways.

    - if the “hard” sciences and the “worldly” schools like business and engineering
    are predominately male, a tacit signal seeps out from the university, suggesting
    that some fields, like literary studies, have become a kind of “woman’s work.”
    such social maladjustments are reflected in the even more worrisome statistics
    about the profession.

    - these figures are alarming.

    - fortunately, they are not replicated here at the university of georgia, but
    a single institution can’t hold out forever against national trends.

    - as i’ve indicated in previous columns, these are hard times for the humanities,
    and we recently saw the president recommend complete defunding of the national
    endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities.

    - fortunately, congress did not accept his recommendation, but the threat remains.

    - hard times is one thing; extinction is something else altogether.

    - a classic of american history is richard hofstadter’s 1963 book anti-intellectualism
    in american life , with its bracing chronicle of everything you’d imagine from
    the title.

    - but hofstadter was sensitive to the fact that the united states, as a democracy,
    has always needed to audition alternative voices, other perspectives; the intellectuals
    had no guaranteed stake in the outcome of public issues.

    - but in times like these, we intellectuals occupy an increasingly precarious
    ground, recently made even more precarious in georgia by the governor’s signing
    into law the “campus carry” bill permitting concealed weapons on campus.

    - as maureen downey’s “get schooled” blog for the atlanta constitution-journal
    reported earlier in may , an open records request revealed that the tally of calls
    against the bill in the 2017 legislative session was 14,873, while the number
    of those in favor was 145. no typo: the discrepancy is that extreme.

    - it gives the phrase “special interests” a whole new profile, doesn’t it?

    - we have legitimate interests as well, but apparently not special enough to count
    .

    - we teach the whole complex world depicted in literary works, in which it’s clear
    that the skullduggery we face in the world today is nothing new.

    - but it’s worth knowing there is historical precedent; it’s important to have
    access to other minds in other times, contending with the same traumas that seem
    so unprecedented today.

    - but there’s a risk in the assessment as well, and i turn in conclusion to a
    warning ventured by the eminent scholar george steiner prefacing his book language
    and silence in 1970 (another moment of acute political trauma): “to think of literature,
    of education, of language, as if nothing very important had happened to challenge
    our very concept of these activities seems to me unrealistic,” he wrote with tactful
    restraint.

    - “to read aeschylus or shakespeare—let alone to ‘teach’ them—as if the texts,
    as if the authority of the texts in our own lives, were immune from recent history,
    is subtle but corrosive illiteracy.”

    - “i don’t know,” i had to admit.

    - what greek sophist is this statue representing?” i had no idea.

    - a long silence was my immediate response.

    - as the proverbial deer in headlights, i could only stare back blankly, and then,
    finally, when the dead silence became too heavy, mumble, “i don’t know.” “demosthenes,”
    she announced to the class, and i registered her disappointment; i had been introduced
    to the class as a scholar of the sophists.

    - yet in defense of my ignorance, i quickly told myself, had she given me a text
    , such as “on the crown,” i might have had a fighting chance to respond differently.

    - that is, i don’t exactly plaster my office walls with posters of the sophists.

    - however, years later, i still feel a need to defend my ignorance.

    - yet isn’t “not knowing” precisely the reason for being a student?

    - indeed, wasn’t that the reason that i chose to become an apprentice of classical
    art and architecture, so that i could learn what i didn’t know?

    - as my primary discipline is rhetorical theory, i wanted to study in a second
    discipline—that of ancient art and aesthetics.

    - my aim was to follow my desire to examine resonances between the principles
    of ancient rhetoric and ancient aesthetics, including principles of symmetry,
    perspective, proportion.

    - so i found myself in the position of a student, humbled by my ignorance.

    - we are, all of us, students.

    - you might say that being a student is our profession.

    - we are students of language, of texts; it is our profession to engage with that
    which we don’t know.

    - this research may, it is hoped, result in publications, but it most certainly
    results in enriched teaching.

    - they need direction, they need to learn the tricks of using a complex system,
    and they need to know the protocol.

    - and of admitting it.

    - and of embracing it.

    - indeed, i am suggesting that for all of us, being a student is to acknowledge
    the limits of our knowledge, to extend a gesture of hospitality toward the unknown,
    and to state without embarrassment, “i don’t know.” passionate learners make effective
    teachers.

    - he has accomplished this first through his passion for the subject-matter he
    teaches and his ability to transfer this passion to his students.

    - his teaching style encourages students to wrestle with the most challenging
    questions of the texts, teaching us to ask these questions ourselves in our own
    readings.

    - we are also grateful for our other donors who provide support to our students.

    - we hope their generosity inspires you, and we hope that you consider contributing
    to the english department’s threefold mission of teaching, research, and community
    research.

    - eliot famously named april the “cruellest month” in his poem the waste land
    (1922), although certainly any month that marks the loss of a friend and colleague
    is the cruellest of all.

    - possessing an intractable will, she was often stubborn, yet easily moved to

    - the christy desmet memorial fund has been established to support graduate students
    working in british literature prior to 1900. to support this fund, please visit:
    gail.uga.edu/christydesmet or send a check payable to the “christy desmet memorial
    fund” to the franklin college of arts and sciences, attn.

    - additionally, we publicly thank dr. deborah miller for assuming the position
    of interim director of the first-year composition program, while we conduct a
    current national search.

    - sending best wishes for a restorative holiday break, and for a regenerative
    new year—where hope may spring, eternally.

    - at the risk of revealing my peculiar threshold of entertainment, when i was
    in graduate school a hundred years ago, my cohort of students used to host a simulacrum
    of academic conferences, and assign ourselves papers to deliver, using theoretical
    frames to critique popular tv shows, such as: a feminist reading of bonanza ;
    a marxist reading of gilligan’s island ; a deconstructive reading of hawaii five-o.

    - (clearly, i am dating myself; some who read this will also recognize when their
    references to popular culture receive blind stares.)

    - but i have incorporated this scholarly play into my classroom, to encourage
    a sense of adventure, to underscore how interpretive strategies can be employed
    variously, in order to provide rich readings of texts.

    - i call this exercise the “lit crit blowout.” at least, i smile.

    - the point of this message is to highlight the intellect, curiosity, and ingenuity
    of our students.

    - one of these “literary theory” students, astra taylor, went on to write several
    books, including examined life and an accompanying dvd of the same title, which
    interviews key theorists and asks them—as the title suggests—how concerns of justice,
    truth, and meaning, for example, inflect our readings.

    - of our graduates this year, i have had the pleasure of learning from the interpretive
    work of students including keamber farley, alex williams, ellen everitt, lukas
    woodyard, rachel dier, mk manoylov, and julia koslowsky.

    - but many more students have graced my rolls over the years.

    - each student has in his/her own way become a teacher—whether in the lit crit
    blowouts, in papers, or in contributions to the department and world more generally.

    - we proudly send our students out into the world, and they do us proud, in return.

    - sadly, we have to also witness the exit of our company from this world.

    - we acknowledge the death of former department head, dr. coburn freer, who passed
    on february 26, 2019, and who is survived by his wife of 57 years mona; daughters
    meagan and elinor and their husbands dan and david; and five grandchildren.

    - he is also survived by a brother and sister-in-law, frank and susan freer, a
    half-sister toni and nieces mary ellen and diane.

    - but we have much to celebrate.

    - santesso encourages her students to keep questioning, to join larger, interdisciplinary
    conversations, and to strive for excellence in and out of the classroom.” even
    as athens slows down to its summer pace, we''ll be in park hall awaiting next
    year''s students, who will bring with them their passion for learning, literature,
    and language.

    - welcome to 2020!

    - and, although not an official anniversary, this new decade marks, roughly, the
    advent of the department of english at the university of georgia, approximately
    one hundred years ago.

    - in a reaction to a national controversy over the value of teaching literature
    in the “mother tongue of our everyday life,” georgia’s board of trustees voted
    in the late 1800s that the teaching of english should be given more prominence,
    and so finally our community of scholars and students was given official sanction,
    as well as the institutional support to sustain us.

    - over the past 100 years, we’ve grown in size, stature, and scope, offering much
    to support the study of “belles lettres,” that is characteristic of the department
    of english.

    - dear friends and colleagues of the english department: whether an overstatement,
    understatement, or an example of hyperbole or litotes, it can be said that this
    fall semester was not.

    - joshua king and caroline young detail in their featured note about teaching
    in prisons, or how students discuss their experiences learning to adjust to new
    pedagogical environments.

    - we send all best wishes for a hopeful 2021—full of promise, joy, and health
    for all.

    - their contributions to our department, to the university, and the greater profession
    have been many, and they will be sorely missed.

    - additionally, i want to acknowledge all of our donors.

    - we express our deep appreciation to all our current—and—future donors.

    - both have served the department with dedication during the past six years in
    their respective administrative positions of associate head and undergraduate
    coordinator.

    - the work done in such administrative positions, along with the work of their
    support staff, is often invisible, but is essential to ensuring the conditions
    of possibility for our individual and collective success.

    - as part of our core mission statement, the department of english is proud to
    offer students “a sympathetic participation in the verbal worlds of other times
    and places, drawing on the full range of linguistic tools, historic knowledge,
    and interpretive experience at our disposal.” aiming to “allow our students to
    enhance their appreciation of expressive possibility,” we hope to develop “a sophisticated,
    practical grasp of the central role that language plays in the preservation of
    human institutions”—and relations, i would add.

    - these theories also invite ethical implications for how one chooses to “be in
    the world.” we each make many choices every day, but choices always have consequences.

    - one of the theorists we read, martha nussbaum, for example, discussed the importance
    of mutual care as a foundation for justice.

    - to me, this idea highlights the lived experience that we are each brought into
    this world, absolutely dependent on the care of others.

    - as a corollary, subsequently, we have the responsibility for others, as well.

    - as many of you don’t know, i live on a farm, and i well know the responsibilities
    of caring for, nurturing, and sustaining all under my care.

    - this “response-ability,” as scholar diane davis notes, means we have an ethical
    obligation to respond to the other, insofar as we are able.

    - we respond when anyone calls us—not necessarily in a moment of distress, but
    when someone says our name or when a stranger hails us.

    - that is: when called, even metaphorically, i turn; i respond , as responsibly
    as i am able, because i acknowledge that there are many who have nurtured me and
    provided opportunity for me.

    - this response becomes the answer to the call to be responsible to these others.

    - all best, michelle ballif

    - although a shake of the magic 8-ball earlier this academic year might have predicted
    otherwise, we conclude the semester with much to celebrate!

    - we are proud to recognize our approximately 120 graduating a.b.

    - students and 8 graduating m.a.

    - and ph.d. students, who succeeded in less-than-ideal circumstances.

    - we also express our gratitude to members of our departmental staff, who spent
    hours preparing the building for pandemic conditions, whilst still assuming their
    normal responsibilities, such as handling budgetary matters and advising students.

    - although the academic year may have ended, we are busy preparing for our fall
    semester.

    - returning students may note that park hall has received a fresh lick of paint
    on the walls and should surely appreciate several renovated bathrooms.

    - dr. hussey has previously worked in our first-year writing program as an instructor,
    as well as taught as a brittain fellow at the georgia institute of technology.

    - we welcome them both and are confident they will continue our teaching mission
    with distinction.

    - as well, the department of english is committed to scholarship and research
    in our collective fields of inquiry.

    - with every best wish, dr. michelle ballif head of the department of english

    - in some ways it was a return to what was, i see more students in my classroom,
    and sitting on the stone wall outside of park hall, reading and chatting, or simply
    sitting with their eyes d. but we''ve all changed over the past two years.

    - for me, the trick is to keep moving forward with belief in what awaits.

    - "''hope is a thing with feathers --," emily dickinson reminds us, "that perches
    in the soul -- / and sings the tune without the words -- / and never stops – at
    all – ".

    - i''m writing this in late april, and the intense green of new leaves outside
    my office promises that spring is about to turn into summer, and thus the end
    of the academic year.

    - we all long for those final weeks of the semester when april becomes may.

    - in academia, there are two temporal cycles, the one that nature offers us and
    the other set forth by the academic calendar.

    - those who are graduating are eager to begin the next phase of their lives, while
    continuing undergraduates and graduate students are already thinking about their
    fall schedules and responsibilities, even if they are also planning to sit in
    the sun and just breathe for at least a few of the hot summer days already promised
    in the air.

    - fall of 2022 saw the retirement of dr. tricia lootens, while dr. michelle ballif,
    our current department head, will be retiring in august.

    - it has been my great pleasure to work with both of these distinguished and dedicated
    colleagues for more than 27 years, and the department will not be the same without
    them, at least not for me.

    - but i''m a romanticist and an idealist and so i''ll turn just slightly away
    from bittersweet goodbyes and the new rhythms they bring, borrowing my final words
    from philip larkin''s "the trees".

    - to all of you, i say "begin afresh, afresh, afresh."

    - well, that was a whirlwind!

    - my first semester as interim head is now in the books, and i could not be more
    grateful for the experience.

    - rather, it is a collective endeavor, an ever-evolving community of students,
    teachers, researchers, staff, and administrators, all of whom—without exception--are
    passionately dedicated to the study of language and writing.

    - this semester brought a variety of changes.

    - instead of spending endless hours on zoom, park hall is once again a busy and
    bustling place.

    - (thank goodness.)

    - they are already contributing to the department in numerous ways and we feel
    fortunate to have them as colleagues.

    - at the same time, we must say a bittersweet farewell to some of the most treasured
    members of the department.

    - tricia lootens, michelle ballif, and barbara bendzunas have all retired.

    - tricia lootens, a widely respected scholar and teacher of victorian literature,
    retired in 2022 after teaching at uga for 29 years.

    - michelle ballif, an eminent scholar of rhetoric and skilled administrator, came
    to uga in 1995 and served as the department head from 2016-22. during their time
    here, drs.

    - lootens and ballif inspired countless students and had an indelible impact on
    their fields, the department, and the university.

    - barbara bendzunas, until her retirement this winter, managed our main office.

    - for the past 11 years, she did everything for the department from making copies
    to sharing fresh treats and vegetables.

    - all of us will miss tricia, michelle, and barbara, and we wish them a happy
    and fulfilling retirement.

    - so to everyone who has contributed to the department of english in one way or
    another, whether now or in the past: thank you so much.

    - spring 2023 was a lively and productive semester for the department of english.

    were made both on and off the page.

    - dr. végső is excited to come to georgia and brings a wealth of experience to
    the position.

    for the first time as the new head of the department of english at the university

    - i am a native of hungary, and i completed most of my education in europe (in
    hungary and germany).

    - my first job after graduation was at the university of tennessee, knoxville.

    - in 2009, i moved to the university of nebraska-lincoln, where i taught for the
    last fourteen years.

    - needless to say, it was an inexhaustible fascination with language that set
    me on this career path.

    - my current research primarily focuses on the first half of the 20th century
    and is located at the crossroads of literary criticism and philosophy.

    - i am also deeply interested in the study and practice of translation, so i am
    always on the lookout for my next translation project.

    - i am happy to report that my first semester in park hall did not disappoint.

    - in light of this auspicious start in my new position, i find it easy to be optimistic
    about what we can accomplish together as a department.

    - i am very much looking forward to working with my colleagues both in english
    and beyond to build an even brighter future.

    interest in material culture, multilingualism, translation.

    her in our front office on the second floor.

    - at the same time, we also had to say goodbye to dr. roxanne eberle, who decided
    to retire at the end of the fall semester.

    - beyond her contributions to the field of british nineteenth-century studies,
    dr. eberle has had a striking impact on the life of the department.

    the english department.

    - as some of you might recall, the fall semester of 2023 started with some unexpected
    news.

    over 80 papers in north america, europe, and asia.

    our students by donating to this fund.

    - 2024 was also a watershed year for one of our other distinguished colleagues.

    - after an illustrious career of dedicated service, dr. kretzschmar, a world-renowned
    linguist, who has been a cornerstone of uga’s department of english, making groundbreaking
    contributions to sociolinguistics and dialectology, particularly through his work
    on the linguistic atlas project, decided to retire.

    - throughout his tenure, dr. kretzschmar inspired countless students across several
    continents and enriched the university’s academic community with his expertise
    and passion.

    in london.” ever since i learned to read, i’ve had a book in my hands.

    - i started my journey at uga with the intention of going to medical school but
    after half a semester of chemistry, i realized i don’t really like the intricacies
    of science…and my test scores showed it.

    - after my midterm exam, i went straight to my student counselor’s office and
    changed my focus to the subject i loved the most, english.

    - i could go on and on about how my time at franklin college enhanced my abilities
    to think in the abstract and build a strong case but there’s one thing that always
    stands out: i know how to tell a story.

    - successful salespeople are all master storytellers.

    - the key lies in seamlessly linking a challenge to its solution and visualizing
    yourself in a prospect''s daily routine.

    marlboro academy (sc), earned her b.a.

    - from western carolina university in 1988, and her ph.d. in english from the
    university of georgia in 1999. she taught english at uga for three decades and
    was beloved by generations of her students.

    - she was an accomplished scholar and teacher and a skilled pianist whose varied
    repertoire ranged from chopin to broadway show tunes to top 40 hits of the 1970s
    and 1980s to the broadman hymnal.

    - she created a beautiful garden at her home in athens that continues to be a
    place of peace and comfort for her family and friends (though in her charming,
    self-deprecating way she once wrote in a poem that she had “failed to ferret out
    the green verbena in its youth”).

    - she loved words and books and wrote a brilliant dissertation on kate chopin
    and other women writers of new orleans.

    - travel was her all-consuming passion, and over many years she and her family
    took trips to the united kingdom, ireland, france, germany, austria, italy, portugal,
    the netherlands, and spain, as well as to new orleans, santa fe, oregon, california,
    and many other places in the united states.

    - in all things, mary anne embraced the beauty and magic she found in the everyday.

    - “i’ve decided that the universe is going to come to me,” she once said, “if
    i can’t go to the universe.” she lived her entire life to the fullest, but particularly
    so in the years since her diagnosis.

    - she traveled widely, befriended many, and fiercly and fully loved fully her
    husband of 25 years, dr. david ingle, and their three children joseph (and his
    wife victoria), madeleine, and eliza.

    - mary anne had a rare combination of fine qualities: a brilliant mind, a formidable
    memory, a gentle spirit, effortless beauty, and an ease about herself that in
    turn put those around her at ease.

    - she possessed resilience, wit, wisdom, grace, and genuine compassion.

    - she was eminently practical yet admirably idealistic.

    - words cannot capture her adequately, but one of her dear friends put it well
    when she said, “when i was with her, i knew i was home.” in addition to her husband
    and children, she is survived by her father, charles o’neal of brownsville, south
    carolina (her mother, celia moore o’neal, predeceased her in 2011), her sister
    martha glover (husband will, niece celia adams, nephews bill and tom glover),
    and her brothers charlie (marsha, bo, and erin), steve (ann, jennifer and scott),
    and johnny (beverly, jessica, joshua, and jacob).

    - after her death, her daughter madeleine discovered the following quote from
    john henry griffith in mary anne’s notes.

    - we think its eloquence should be shared: “i am convinced that there is something
    more: that human consciousness is independent of the body and that the death of
    the body is not an ending of consciousness -- it is rather a passing.

    - my parting wish for my friends is that they nurture compassion and walk humbly
    in the presence of unfathomable mystery.”

    - this isn’t a journey i often share, but it’s the one that happened, and i don’t
    wish it otherwise.

    - i went on to fall in love with early modern literature, and after graduate school
    i’ve since found my way back to a creative world, too.

    - picking just one is exceptionally difficult!

    - i devoured it!

    - i remember feeling totally on fire yet totally overwhelmed.

    - those feelings must have registered plainly on my face in that second week of
    class, because dr. d said “forrester, you look totally lost.

    - did you know that’s the best place to be?”.

    - i didn’t know it at the time, but dr. d was telling we that there was a great
    intellectual worth in curiosity, uncertainty; to be lost was to ever be in a place
    to find.

    - that exchange stuck with me as a motivator for finding my footing whenever i
    felt stuck in my work during my doctoral study.

    - writing skills so often decide crucial opportunities for us, whether that be
    jobs, fellowships, graduate schools, or other markers of professionalization.

    - writing is a skill that never ceases to be asked of us, whether that be in workspaces,
    social media spaces, or basic spaces of communication.

    - rebecca makkai’s the great believers (2018) has stuck with me as the most memorable
    read of my adult life.

    - the book unfolds around a queer community in chicago during the aids crisis
    and explores how that tragedy shapes their lives as they search for meaning, goodness,
    resolution, and joy in its aftermath.

    - it ticked my boxes.

    - i recently finished tomorrow, tomorrow, and tomorrow (2022) by gabrielle zevin
    at the advice of a very trusted avid worker.

    - jennifer martin graduated from uga with a master''s in english in 2011. currently,
    she serves as an english instructor in a title 1 high school - peach county high.

    - she teaches american literature, advanced placement, american sign language,
    and journalism.

    - her short story "the notes between shalom" was recently published by syncopation
    literary journal.

    - i encountered characters and questions that i never would have previously considered.

    - i fell in love with the possibilities and escapes that reading can provide.

    - dr. reg mcknight treated me more like family than as a mere student.

    - all these years later, i still attribute much of my success to dr. mcknight;
    to say he was both supportive and inspirational would be an understatement.

    - i also learned american sign language at uga with judi oliver; i now teach that
    as well.

    - my favorite book is bastard out of carolina by dorothy allison.

    - i just finished educated by tara westover.

    - it is riveting and shows that nonfiction reading is not just boring history
    and facts.

    - it also provides inspiration for teachers and lessons for parents.

    - josh cohen ’s article, "superman as the measure of all things: black gods and
    white saviours in watchmen and doomsday clock ," was published in literature and
    theology .

    - especially interesting is the introduction of illustrative quotations into the
    essay from a variety of literary sources – most notably from jonathan swift’s
    a tale of tub first printed in 1704 – which most likely precedes this practice
    in samuel johnson’s dictionary, and most certainly, the new english dictionary
    edited by james murray.

    - as the new front office and creative writing assistant, jami mays wears a lot
    of hats.

    - “i plan to die in this office,” she jokes, after discussing the joy the position
    has brought her.

    - prior to this job, jami worked with a local athens labor advocacy and workers
    justice non-profit.

    - though she valued the work and felt passionate about the difference she was
    making in the community, the labor it demanded of her was unsustainable.

    - it was difficult to find the separation she needed between her work and personal
    life.

    - after covid, during which she worked advocating for teachers that were similarly
    burnt out, she felt she needed a change and applied for a open positions at uga.

    where her passions lie.

    - “i’m not sure exactly what that will be, but i’m excited to find out.” she mentions
    art and english and potential contenders, but also says that she wants to take
    time to explore her interests and truly experience the joy of learning for the
    sake of learning.

    - her office already boasts items she’s made: a pencil crocheted from rope and
    a basket.

    - in the future, she wants to learn how to make clothes.

    - jami also enjoys writing, specifically narrative non-fiction.

    - years ago, she helped produce a creative writing show in atlanta, write club.

    - it’s well known as the world’s largest “combative philanthropic literary bloodsport,”
    wherein writers compete to compose and present a piece about two very different
    ideas for charity.

    - “i really enjoyed the freedom and collaboration of that environment,” she says.

    - additionally, jami likes to spend time with her family; her husband is the executive
    chef at mama’s boy, and she has two children, one 21 and one eight.

    - “he’s at the age where he still loves me,” she jokes about her younger son,
    who she enjoys quality time with when she volunteers at his elementary school.

    - finally, if jami had to show aliens anything from earth, she would show them
    the ongoing lifespan of the internet, from its genesis in the 90s to the present.

    - to provide them with an understanding of humanity, she would show them napster,
    aol, aim, and myspace; the complete journey from there to now.

    - “it’s the most accessible and connected thread for the last 20-30 years for
    how humanity has progressed.

    - everything - pop culture, music, history - it’s all interwoven.” i can think
    of some things i wouldn’t want aliens to see on the internet, but jami seems to
    be a glass half full person.

    - hopefully the aliens won’t decide to smite us after seeing all the internet
    has to offer.

    - dr. mattison’s office is south-facing, so the mid-morning sun illuminates the
    medieval posters on the walls and the books on the shelves.

    - it’s a welcoming space -- there’s even a wire basket of snacks by her desk.

    - despite the homey style of her office, dr. mattison hasn’t called georgia home
    for long.

    - she received her b.a.

    - since her undergraduate career, dr. mattison has been drawn to medieval studies.

    - while studying at oxford, dr. mattison was able to access many more primary
    sources, such as medieval books, documents, manuscripts, and buildings, that led
    her to view books and languages as reflections of medieval culture and society.

    - by studying medieval texts and how language functions within them, she hopes
    to open new windows for analyzing the past.

    - in one example of her research, dr. mattison discusses an old, popular arthurian
    legend.

    - it was spread through england, but instead of being written in old english,
    it was written in french.

    - it is this type of syncretism of languages, literatures, and cultures that is
    so fascinating to dr. mattison.

    - however, this intersection is under-researched, as people from both sides of
    study - english and french - are unsure where, exactly, the literature falls under.

    - luckily, dr. mattison cares little for categories, and far more about the important
    conclusions that might be drawn from a more interdisciplinary study of these types
    of literature and language.

    - the physical study of manuscripts is also a passion of dr. mattison’s.

    - between old, decaying pages, many treasures can be found.

    - for example, a flower, pressed between lines of latin, aged and forgotten.

    - “it’s interesting to think about how something that for them was an everyday
    object has become such a valuable source to us,” she says.

    - there are less romantic things, like dirt, or even book curses -- violent poems
    directing misfortune and injury at book thieves.

    - what wonderful continuity; hundreds of years ago people treasured their books
    just as much as they do today.

    - dr. mattison is just as cool outside of her office as she is in it.

    - first off, she was wearing a sweater that she had knitted herself when i interviewed
    her -- you can’t get cooler than that.

    - she also enjoys cooking, and doesn’t limit herself to one culture either.

    - in contrast to the serenity dr. mattison says cooking brings her, she seeks
    the adrenaline provided by top-roping, a style of rock climbing.

    - “it’s very stress relieving,” she says sarcastically, “to be twenty, thirty
    feet off the ground.” to relax from that harrowing experience, dr. mattison enjoys
    watching bad reality tv, reading all of jane austen (especially emma ), and listening
    to boygenius.

    - to wrap up the interview, i ask dr. mattison a question i’ve been thinking about:
    if she could show something created by humanity to an alien society, what would
    it be?

    - she takes a moment to think, then says, “notre dame.” beyond its architectural
    and historical significance, the building itself is representative of 19th century
    medievalism, which has its roots in “colonialism, nostalgia, and nationalism.”
    these issues bleed into the value placed today on “white, western, christian art”
    over non-western art, as seen with reactions to the 2019 fire at notre dame versus
    the lack of sympathy for other losses of cultural heritage.

    - “for me, notre dame is as much an idea of the past as part of the actual past.”
    to show aliens notre dame is to show them the refracted rainbow of humanity: the
    dreams, the losses, and the bones the present is built upon.

    - instead, the english department sought him for the position.

    - at the time, he was teaching at louisiana state university, where his work focused
    on african american literature and multi-ethnic southern literature.

    - his love for football also influenced his decision, and he is proud to have
    witnessed two championship wins during his time at uga, confessing that “[he]
    loves the dawgs and the traditions of the game.” originally from atlanta, dr.
    lowe received his b.a.

    - instead, he went to law school at emory university, but he was only able to
    complete one year of the program before being drafted into the army.

    - after serving in the army, he worked as a financial analyst at donne and bradstreet
    in atlanta, but he quickly became “restless” there.

    - his wife persuaded him to attend graduate school under the gi bill, and he attended
    georgia state “because [he] couldn’t afford emory” at the time.

    - initially, his dissertation focused on “faulkner, melville, and the bible,”
    but when traveling to spain with his wife, “all [his] melville books were stolen
    with [their] luggage.” because he needed to finish his dissertation to begin his
    post at st. mary’s college in notre dame, he “dropped melville, and [st. mary’s]
    never knew that.” he taught at st. mary’s for four years before receiving a mellon
    appointment at harvard in african american studies.

    - he decided to re-enter the job market now that his recommendation letters were
    all written on harvard stationary.

    - out of over fourteen interviews, he accepted a position at lsu, and “[he] never
    thought [he’d] leave” until uga “came calling.” while he “knew there was a job”
    in southern literature open at uga, he “wasn’t interested,” but that quickly changed.

    - he has now been teaching southern literature at the university of georgia since
    2012. although he was initially “torn” between lsu and uga, he says, “[coming
    to uga] was a good decision, and i’ve been happy here.

    - although he is known for his work in southern literature, he has cast his net
    much more widely, working in multi-ethnic southern literature that includes african
    american, native american, italian american, asian american, and caribbean literature.

    - as he remarked, when it comes to southern literature, “you name it,” and he’s
    done it.

    - he sets apart a few defining moments within his career.

    - at lsu, he directed their summer program in italy for six years, and even now,
    his office is decorated with photographs of the classes he took to italy.

    - he received a fulbright in munich and was one of the founders of african american
    studies at lsu.

    - he is “proudest” of the conference he organized for melus (multi-ethnic literature
    of the united states) in 2015 at uga.

    - his newest book, black hibiscus: african americans and the florida imaginary
    , will be published soon, and he is currently editing a book on colson whitehead.

    - with numerous book projects still in the works, dr. lowe “is still busy” as
    his retirement approaches, and he plans to keep it that way.

    - realizing that he is “really an office person” and “can’t work at home,” his
    first goal in retirement is “try to develop the ability to work at home,” but
    his main priority is to “keep doing [his] books and…going to conferences.” his
    retirement will not be all work, however.

    - he wants to start working out with his wife through silver sneakers, play racquet
    ball with a longtime friend from louisiana, and play the piano more “seriously.”
    he is a “serious cook” and plans on hosting more dinner parties while learning
    spanish through lacsi (latin american caribbean studies institute).

    - he is travelling to france in september for a southern literature conference.

    - out of his retirement plans, he is “most looking forward to finishing [the]
    biography [of ernest gaines]”: “it’s really a burden for me…it’s the first one,
    and he asked me to write it.

    - i have a solemn promise to him.

    - he died in 2019…i’m writing it for him.

    - i’m not writing it for me.

    - i want his reputation to be larger than it is now and have more people reading
    him.” as dr. lowe prepares for retirement, he looks back on his career while looking
    forward to the legacies that he wants to leave.

    - he hopes that his teaching has left students not only with the “skills to better
    understand the value of literature,” but also the skills “to make them better
    citizens.” he believes that “literature often gives you guideposts for life,”
    which helps students become better (literary) citizens in the world through what
    they read.

    - he is “proud of [his] legacy with graduate students,” having directed twenty-nine
    dissertations throughout his career.

    - for him, his biggest legacy lies in his work with african american ph.d. students
    at lsu.

    - he keeps pictures of those students in his office, noting that “they’ve all
    gone on to be great teachers and administrators all over the country.” he sees
    those students as “carrying on the work [he’s] done.

    - he is confident that his relationship with those friendships “will continue.”
    he and his wife have no intentions of leaving athens anytime soon.

    - rather, he reassures us, “we’ll be here.” brianna phillips is an english ph.d.
    student and fyw instructor in the english department at uga.

    - (originally published in the franklin college of arts and sciences news page)
    eight humanities departments within the franklin college of arts and sciences
    at the university of georgia participated in an october clothing drive to support
    the efforts of the student government association clothing t .

    - staffed by student government members and volunteers, the sga clothing t is
    sourced almost entirely by clothing donations.

    - the departments of comparative literature and intercultural studies, english,
    germanic & slavic studies, history, linguistics, philosophy, religion, and romance
    languages participated in the effort.

    - my books add up to over a million words.

    - thankfully the number of book covers is more modest, and on the principle that
    a picture says more than a thousand words, i’m happy to have them make up a parade.

    - looking back on the 15 titles i published between 1986 and 2022, the covers
    sort out into these categories.

    - i didn’t like the cover of wax at all, but the book made my reputation, so i
    can’t complain.

    - the others are fetching.

    - but i now find the cover of my last book, what the thunder said , a tad busier
    than i’d like.

    - i’ve been very lucky with designers who took an image i provided and really
    made it zing.

    - [ this compost, syncopations, modernism and poetic inspiration, acrobatic modernism,
    genre and extravagance in the novel, and wreading ] i think they’re all stunning,
    though i’m especially fond of the color palette the university of georgia press
    found for this compost , and i love the way oxford set off the single lens surrealist
    eyeglass for acrobatic modernism.

    - there are two covers i designed myself.

    - my first book was a collection of poems and drawings, tabula rasula , which
    i did while working as a typesetter and graphic designer before my academic career.

    - the other was history of a shiver .

    - oxford then accepted it as a cover, but changed the typeface to a sans serif
    font.

    - i preferred what i’d done for oregon, but the difference is negligible.

    - the final category is a bit of each of the above.

    - my history of dada, destruction was my beatrice , used an image of hugo ball
    performing at cabaret voltaire in zurich in 1916, and while i’d suggested the
    image i hadn’t provided it.

    - but it’s iconic, and i love the color design on the black and white photo.

    - my favorite rendition is the treatment given the whole book by atlanta artist
    brian dettmer, who specializes in excavating the innards of books, working diligently
    with an exacto knife.

    - he sought my permission to buy two rare copies of the out of print book to cut
    it up.

    - one is now among my favorite possessions.

    - nina''s speech was meet with thunderous applause.

    - dr. legette then announced the gradutes who were met with their own thunderous
    applause.

    - 2023 marks the 250th anniversary of the publication of phillis wheatley peters’
    poems on various subjects, religious and moral (london, 1773), the first known
    book of poetry by a black woman in what would become the us.

    - after speaking to national colleagues about this sesquicentennial, we learned
    that most did not have programs planned.

    - they have attracted national and international attendees and participants, and
    funding from georgia humanities, humanities texas, and the willson center.

    - one highlight was a panel discussion of materials in the american antiquarian
    society (aas), the largest repository of pre-twentieth century american literature,
    which included aas archivists who described how the humanities prepared them for
    their careers.

    - we also have a program or two in the works for 2024. stay tuned!

    - hallman-martini said that she was nominated by two of her colleagues.

    - “i love that the writing center is a place focused specifically on supporting
    student writers in whatever ways they want/need,” said hallman-martini, noting
    that students can work on academic, professional, creative, and/or personal writing
    at the writing center.

    - she also likes being a part of a space at the university that is less concerned
    with hierarchy, grades, or the “product” of writing.

    - additionally, hallman-martini finds working with consultants outside of the
    traditional classroom setting a rewarding experience.

    - as assistant director, he tries to implement practices that boost confidence
    in clients.

    - as department head, he introduced several new traditions, some academic.

    - some of the traditions were non-academic, like having picnics and canoeing at
    a lake.

    - mrs. ramona freer, his wife, said dr. freer loved teaching and his students.

    - "he was a tough teacher […] and he really loved being in the department," mrs.
    freer said.

    - "he had wonderful colleagues, and they were very supportive.” outside of teaching,
    dr. freer loved watching american football (especially uga football!

    - ), bicycling, and his airedale terriers, all of which had shakespearean names.

    - he also enjoyed travelling and working on cars.

    - mrs. freer remembers when she and her husband were driving in germany, and dr.
    freer asked to stop at a house that had famous formula one race cars.

    - her husband asked the guard if he could take a look at the car and the race
    track.

    - “it was just hilarious,” said mrs. freer.

    - “and for him, that was the high part of the summer as far as i’m concerned.”
    dr. freer died of lewy body dementia in 2019. his wife ramona freer, and their
    daughters meg and elinor, wanted to establish a scholarship in his honor and keep
    his beloved memory alive.

    - “they didn’t want to call mom and dad and ask for money,” said mrs. freer.

    - “they insisted on doing it on their own, but it was hard [...] so i know what
    they’re [graduate students are] going through.” “it’d be nice to be able to help
    somebody, somebody who really needed the help,” continued mrs. freer.

    - although his research interests focused on 16th and 17th-century english literature,
    dr. freer also loved modern poetry.

    - his three favorite things to read were milton, shakespeare, and the bible.

    - because of his various literary interests, dr. freer’s daughters did not want
    the scholarship to be limited to just those wanting to study in the elizabethan
    age.

    - instead, it will be open to graduate students showing great interest in doing
    further research for whatever their specialty may be.

    - but perhaps more importantly, it will allow us all to remember someone integral
    to the spirit of park hall.

    - jessica demarco-jacobson is a master’s student in the english department at
    uga.

    - it is named for virginia rucker walter, who was an undergraduate at uga in the
    1980s.

    - virginia walter was killed by a drunk driver before she was able to graduate,
    but her family presents this prize in honor of her memory and in celebration of
    her love of literature.

    - her research investigates the power of literature—in forms both traditional
    and unconventional—to inhibit and enact social change with a focus in latin american
    and feminist contexts.

    - in addition to writing, she adores singing, baking cakes, weightlifting, and
    completing her daily crossword puzzle.

    - the day is overcast yet warm, the way georgia is as it steps forward and back
    into spring.

    - he hovers high above us, and at someone’s request, takes a photo of our club
    corralled into one of the archive’s narrowed corridors, as we grin in the cold.

    - many of us in the room immediately assented, having felt that there was a lack
    of undergraduate community within park hall.

    - to many, this was the chance to form a true community, where english undergraduate
    students could share resources, develop camaraderie, and plan their futures beyond
    the arch together.

    - so when spring semester came, that same group of students reconvened, and broke
    ground on building the new english undergraduate association.

    - they held an election, selecting a president, vice-president, and other essential
    board members, and made a list of goals for the semester.

    - one of the most important initiatives spearheaded by the undergraduate english
    association was opening a study hall within park hall.

    - prior to this endeavor, many students felt park hall lacked community.

    - dr. joshua king has been playing and writing with video games since his doctoral
    days at the university of georgia.

    - for him, game design is about choice and creating experiences for the player
    in the same way that texts implement specific rhetorical choices to shape a certain
    experience for the reader.

    - when “you’re reading, you’re having the experience based on the words someone
    else wrote,” an experience “designed” by the writer.

    - “games do the same thing” because “when you’re playing a game, you’re having
    fun or you’re being frustrated or you’re competing with people because of rules
    that someone else made.” while “a read experience is kind of quiet.

    - it’s so internalized, and reading is so familiar that we really don’t think
    about it,” “playing a game is a loud experience” that demonstrates how choice
    “create[s] experiences” that “move us.” even as he strives to revitalize rhetoric
    for students through video games, he notes that in many respects, his game-based
    writing classroom is still “a traditional writing and rhetoric class,” though
    you will see students playing games such as the stanley parable and what remains
    of edith finch .

    - students learn about the writing process, rhetorical devices, and academic research
    as they discuss texts such as richard lamb’s economies of attention and shira
    chess’s ready player two.

    - what “sets this [class] apart from all other ones” is his decision to give students
    the whole semester to design their games instead of only 4-6 weeks.

    - with only a month to work on their projects, students felt that their projects
    “were over before they really got to dig in.” in fall 2022, dr. king also tried
    out “studio mondays,” which were designated workdays that alternated between guided
    workshops, “guided play tests” between students, and individual, self-guided work
    time.

    - he was prepared to “stop doing studio mondays if it stops being productive,”
    but “it never did.” every monday, students were “doing amazing, impressive things.

    - the most constructive move that writing instructors can make, dr. king suggests,
    is “defamiliarizing” the familiar for students.

    - he “defamiliarizes rhetoric” through game-playing, urging students to question
    what it means to play a game and read a text or to design a game and write a text.

    - there is value, he contends, in teaching writing “unconventionally” and “approaching
    it from [a] different angle” because an unfamiliar approach “takes this thing
    that we think is really normal and boring, like writing and reading and…dramatizes
    the fact that it’s not normal or boring at all.

    - in that way, defamiliarizing rhetoric simultaneously foregrounds how familiar
    rhetoric is by emphasizing how much our daily lives are “surrounded” by it.

    - as students realize how “language moves us,” the fact that language moves the
    world and that we “move” language daily becomes tangibly, powerfully ordinary.

    - for dr. king, the first year writing classroom is a space in which the normal
    becomes as defamiliarized as it is familiarized.

    - only then can we “keep limber” our experiences of language.

    - brianna phillips is an english ph.d. student and fyw instructor in the english
    department at uga.

    - the samples would become part of one of her student’s creative projects, which
    she shows me proudly.

    - “it’s something i’ll miss,” she says.

    - “experiencing the joy of students making these rediscoveries and sharing it.”
    it’s poetic that dr. eberle is finishing her career at uga teaching austen, as
    at the beginning of her career at uga she taught the first class offered by uga
    on jane austen.

    - she continued to teach austen and 18th and 19th century british literature.

    - twenty-nine years later, she’s held positions in administration: two terms as
    the undergraduate coordinator, one as social media coordinator, and most recently
    she was associate head for two years.

    - no matter what position she held, though, dr. eberle always maintained her passion
    for teaching.

    - she says that one of the things she’ll miss most is the moments of unique insight
    and discovery that can only be found in the classroom.

    - “there are just moments of pure joy,” she says.

    - moments where she introduces a student to a novel or poem, and they have an
    insight that “blows my mind.” there are funny moments too; for example, when a
    student titled an essay “samuel taylor coleridge, the drug addict” after she had
    mentioned his addiction to laudanum in passing.

    - dr. eberle felt it was an important lesson for her future teaching philosophies,
    which are largely informed by making sure students have proper context and biography,
    so that they can better engage with and understand the work.

    - later in her career, dr. eberle feels fortunate to have been able to mentor
    a host of wonderful graduate students.

    - “watching them grow and flourish has been really important—truly priceless,”
    she says.

    - paralleling her love of teaching is dr. eberle’s love of books.

    - “i got my first purse when i was eight, and i got it solely for the purpose
    of keeping books in there,” she says, laughing.

    - “i was chewing gum and reading a magazine, and i got a call from ucla offering
    me a fellowship.” at ucla, her dissertation shifted from virginia woolf to a passion
    that has endured for her: lesser-known women writers of the romantic era.

    - while she loved—and still loves—virginia woolf and the well-known writers of
    that period, she “[loves] the detective work of learning about these women writers,
    who had been so well-known in their period, but completely forgotten with time.”
    after 29 years at uga, though, dr. eberle is looking forward to the future.

    - “i’ve loved every minute, but i’m also pretty excited about the next stage,”
    she says.

    - in california, where dr. eberle plans to move with her husband, waits a sizable
    family, and her daughter, who is finishing her last year at berkeley.

    - the project she is most anticipating is finishing her second book, amelia opie’s
    sociable lives , and reading all of virginia woolf’s writing— “from the very beginning
    to the very end in chronological order, inclusive of novels, letters, and diaries.”
    she says she feels it’s fitting to her “narrative arc” because her journey in
    academia began with virginia woolf, so it provides a satisfying symmetry to wrap
    it up the same way.

    - most important to dr. eberle, though, is to never stop growing.

    - the virginia rucker walter poetry prize for an undergraduate poet is named for
    virginia rucker walter, who was a poet and student at uga in the 1980s.

    - he loves the intersection between art and technology.

    - 3rd place: jason hawkins ginger ko, judge: "...draws images so vividly that

    is, in some sense, a form of “storytelling.” what is so impressive about her eportfolio

    roland.

    - roland was born to an intellectually driven family mostly composed of mathematicians
    and engineers in nyíregyháza, hungary in the midst of the cold war.

    - although his family encouraged him to follow in their footsteps, roland found
    that literature provided a way to imagine life outside of the historical circumstances
    he grew up in.

    - roland entered university right after the cold war, when hungarian academia
    was trying to reignite its intellectual traditions, and what he called a “transitional
    decade.” “people were really all over the country, looking for new ideas, and
    trying to imagine a completely new future that was unimaginable to that point,”
    said roland.

    - “so it was very exciting to be at the university at that time.” during his time
    at the university of debrecen, roland became interested in the hungarian literary
    philosopher, györgy lukács, whose work was largely forgotten in the 90s.

    - roland’s work led him to a university in germany, but hungary was not part of
    the eu at the time, making logistics difficult.

    - one of his advisors suggested he apply to american universities where he would
    have more opportunities, and he accepted an offer from state university of new
    york at buffalo.

    - his first job was at the university of tennessee, knoxville, and then he worked
    for the university of nebraska-lincoln for 9 years before arriving at uga.

    - outside of his job, roland spends most of his time with his children, but he
    also enjoys music, yoga, and walking.

    - although he grew up listening to many athens-based musicians, he never visited
    until his interview for his current job.

    - welcome to uga, roland!

    - clare reid is the manager of the first-year writing program, where she manages
    day-to-day operations such as managing schedules, the calendar, the list-serv,
    and deals with student complaints.

    - basically, she says, “if it comes to first-year writing, it comes to me first.”
    her main passion in this job is pedagogy outreach; two years ago at georgetown
    she taught graduate students how to teach.

    - clare is exceedingly passionate about pedagogy and professional development.

    - with her color-coded spreadsheets, binders, and journals, she stays on top of
    everything in her role as a “catch-all” for first-year writing.

    - she enjoys reading the variety of syllabi within english 1101 and 1102, especially
    the unique topics, such as horror, walt whitman, and even the percy jackson series.

    - her work focuses on medieval art made by these women as it relates to “embodied
    cognition”—the process of flowed thinking, when the body is doing a physical task
    but the mind operates in a flowing state of thought.

    - “the nuns used work and specifically artistic creation as a form of mediation
    and prayer,” she says.

    - “and they were aware of this concept of flow…and why they were doing their art.”
    her passion derives from the fact that this undiscussed history rebukes much of
    the common perceptions about middle-age women, which often characterize them as
    isolated and having little intelligent thought, much less artistic ability.

    - because of this interest, clare focused on the art and lives of these medieval
    women for her master’s capstone project, which you can find here .

    - it’s a very impressive multi-media project that showcases six activities based
    on what she describes as “multi-century, multi-modal ways to experience the art
    medieval nuns were doing.” you can even recreate some of the nuns’ art!

    - beyond park hall, clare says she reads “a shocking number of books”—90 last
    year and 28 so far this year (probably much higher now, as this article was published
    weeks after the interview).

    - she likes to be in touch with her artistic side; she knits, cooks, sews, paints,
    and keeps a bullet journal, which i’m sure is very detailed.

    - her favorite thing to bake is bread; she described in detail how she bakes three
    loaves a week for herself and her fiance!

    - she is also a veteran of nanowrimo, having spent a decade completing the challenge
    annually.

    - but she’s a bit worried about completing it this year: “i’m getting married
    this year, and i’m having my wedding in the middle of november—am i going to get
    it done?” she laughs.

    - “we’ll see.” she enjoys the projects that come out of the race against the clock
    that is nanowrimo, whether they be good or just ridiculous fun.

    - to our interview, i asked clare who her favorite poets are.

    - she has great taste; she recited sappho, mary oliver, and billy collins in the
    span of minutes.

    - a poem of mary oliver’s, whom she described as one of her favorite poets from
    childhood, has turned in my head for hours.

    - it is what mary oliver said at her partner’s funeral: “ when we pray to love
    god perfectly, / surely we do not mean only.

    - / (lord, see how well i have done.

    - ).” just one floor up from clare, i found peyton mitchell in her office.

    - peyton mitchell is the office assistant for park hall and the assistant for
    uga’s creative writing program.

    - she graduated from uga quite recently—in fall 2022—with a bachelor of fine arts
    in drawing and painting.

    - because she didn’t want to leave athens just yet, she found a place within park
    hall as the office assistant, which handles mail distribution, student questions,
    and general office management.

    - mitchell’s natural creativity drew her to art from a young age.

    - “my mom has a painting hanging in my childhood home that i did when i was three,”
    she says, smiling fondly.

    - though she dabbled in interdisciplinary modes of art, such as 2-d and 3-d, her
    heart always gravitates towards drawing and painting.

    - the first step she took to becoming professionally trained was not at uga, but
    georgia southern, where she spent two years.

    - as she was nearing the end of her second year, she felt she and her husband—who
    was also going to school there—needed a change, so they moved to athens around
    the same time the pandemic began.

    - it was at uga that mitchell created “lost in intimate reverie,” her exit show
    for the lamar dodd school of art.

    - her work is influenced by the impressionist movement because of how the artists
    redefined the use of light in painting, and especially monet.

    - “i love that towards the end of his life, monet was defining things a lot less…it
    became about color,” she says.

    - she wanted to incorporate undefined style and use of light into her own work.

    - “my paintings are of flowers and landscapes but what i’m really engaging with
    is color.” i don’t really think ‘engaging’ quite captures what mitchell does with
    color; she embodies it in her art.

    - the hues—neon orange, fuschia, deep blues and violets—explode from the canvas
    and ignite a spark in the mind.

    - beneath the vibrancy of her art lies a determination: “my goal in painting is
    not to focus on personal traumas…i don’t owe you my hardship.

    - i want to create light and a space for people to get lost in that.” to get lost
    in the light, take a look at mitchell’s work here .

    - beyond work, mitchell and her husband can be seen within molly’s and thousand
    faces coffee on the weekends.

    - in her free time, mitchell enjoys crochet (her first project was a jacket) and
    reading, especially poetry and novels.

    - fantasy is her favorite genre, which she links to the escapism intrinsic to
    her identity as a painter.

    - her favorite poet is mary oliver; she decorated her graduation cap with the
    final two lines from mary oliver’s poem “the summer day”: “tell me, what is it
    you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?” mitchell seems to be doing
    very well with hers.

    - (that’s two hits for mary oliver!)

    - literary history : one of the department’s core strengths linking scholars working
    in many different fields is a shared interest in literary history.

    - we contribute to the study of literary history in all its cultural and formal
    diversity.

    - literature as a media technology: one of the strengths of our department lies
    in our focus on writing as a media technology and on literature as an art form
    that is necessarily in interaction with other media technologies.

    - we offer a deep history of these media technologies that goes back all the way
    to the middle ages and traces the complex histories of these formations from the
    beginnings of manuscript and print culture to comic books, digital technologies,
    and indigenous ai.

    - the south, the global south, and empire: the study of the literature of the
    american south has long been a priority for our department.we are especially interested
    in expanding the scope of our research activities in this area to include the
    literary and cultural products of the global south.

    - our department forms an important part of a collective of scholars at uga who
    are devoted to the study of post-colonial theory and criticism.

    - nation, transnationalism, translation: our discipline is fundamentally rooted

    - yet the global presence of english in its interactions with other languages
    and cultures presents additional opportunities for us to explore broader forms
    of language use and complex cultural relations.

    - our department is especially interested in exploring the various ways in which
    acts of translation constituted in a fundamental way to the formation of anglophone
    literary traditions.

    - as scholars, writers, intellectuals, teachers, and students, books are our livelihood.

    - but what if books themselves were our objects of study?

    - books are bound things, repositories of knowledge, memory systems, complex networks
    of paper, ink, stitching, board, leather, and manufacture.

    - and books are not fixed in form; they have changed and continue to change to
    meet the demands and innovations of information culture, from scrolls and tablets
    to medieval illuminated manuscripts, early modern commonplace books, nineteenth
    century serial novels, twentieth century futurist books bound in metal, to twenty-first
    century digital books and e-readers--the ancient tablet in its most contemporary
    form.

    part of the graduate student experience.

    department for funds to support travel once per fiscal year.

    - since funds are limited, these students should not anticipate full funding.

    - once ph.d. students enter their fifth semester of graduate study at uga, they
    are eligible to apply to the graduate school for funding .

    - most of our ph.d. and second-year m.a.

    - thanks to the required training offered by the first-year composition (fyc)
    program, our tas enter the classroom well prepared and supported by a network
    of teaching mentors.

    - an advantage of graduate literary studies at uga, as compared with other institutions
    in the southeast, is the uga-at-oxford program , founded in 1989 by a medievalist,
    dr. judy shaw.

    - the program is an academically rigorous undergraduate study-abroad opportunity,
    which employs graduate students as resident administrators throughout the year.

    - now in the care of dr. james mcclung, who teaches in postcolonial, british,
    and american literature (20th-c.) in the english department, the program offers
    ph.d. students the opportunity to compete for a small number of assistantships
    in oxford.

    the effect of nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century technologies on the perception
    of race, gender, class and nationality in american literature.

    - her visit is sponsored by the willson center and the franklin college visiting
    scholars fund.

    - samuel beckett was attuned to how nazi propaganda employed catastrophic threats
    of starvation and saving prophesies of plenitude to justify atrocity.

    - dr. james mcnaughton freshly argues that beckett has endgame perform the aftermath
    of these strategies to broaden debates about what counts as genocide postwar,
    to source recent starvation policies in european imperialism, and to extend james
    joyce''s indictment of literary complicity.

    - kate o’brien’s fiction has rarely been read as modernist.

    - yet, like the satirical exercises of her late modernist contemporaries samuel
    beckett and flann o’brien, her writing forms a critique of the political and social
    specifics of late free state ireland.

    - o’brien’s 1938 novel pray for the wanderer is part of a collection of irish
    novels published in the late 1930s which exhibit a late modernist concern with
    the relationship between art and its political context(s).

    - like beckett’s murphy (1938) and flann o’brien’s at swim-two-birds (1939), the
    novel’s central character is an irish man and artist who is alienated from an
    ireland in which “the family is the fundamental unit group of society” (the constitution
    of ireland 1937, article 41.1.2).

    - pray for the wanderer grapples uneasily with the transition from the irish free
    state to éire and the dawning of a political frontier in which catholic values
    are not only predominant, but are firmly manifest in the constitution.

    - although the novel has been read primarily as an eloquent response to censorship,
    the irish constitution of 1937 is the focal point for o’brien’s concerns about
    the erosion of individual liberty.

    - written concurrently with the drafting of the constitution, the novel probes
    the ideologies of familism and pro-natalism in their legislative and social forms,
    exploring their impact on art, citizenship and personal autonomy at a political
    turning point in post-independence ireland.

    - dr laura lovejoy is a postdoctoral fellow at the school of english, university
    college cork.

    - she is currently working on a monograph, "ireland, late modernism and reproduction",
    which explores the relationship between late irish modernism and reproductive
    politics.

    - the monograph considers how a collection of novels by james joyce, samuel beckett,
    flann o''brien and kate o''brien responded to the ideologies of domesticity, pro-natalism
    and familism as they were manifest in the political landscape of free state ireland.

    - her research interests include historical approaches to modernism, biopolitics,
    and the relationship between modernism and commercial sex.

    - she made, remade, reordered and selectively suppressed her poems many times
    during her life, making the establishment of a “definitive” moore canon nearly
    impossible.

    - the past decade, however, has seen a renaissance in the editing of her work,
    revealing a poet quite different from the one her posthumous readers thought they
    knew.

    - she is the author of numerous articles on modern american poetry as well as
    two critical editions of moore''s poems: adversity and grace: marianne moore,
    1936-1941 (els editions, 2012) and a-quiver with significance: marianne moore,

    - her research focuses on 20th-century germany through the history and historiography
    of art exhibitions and their mediation in catalogues, installation photographs,
    and film.

    - her current book project explores the concept of the “installation shot,” through

    sculpture kneeling woman (1911) at different landmark modernist exhibitions in
    germany and the united states between 1912 and 1955. other recent projects include
    guest editing a special issue of the journal dada/surrealism on the history of

    - her books on marianne moore (1981) and elizabeth bishop (1991) were among the

    is undertaking research for his monograph the distance of irish modernism , which
    investigates the paradox through which the irish modernist novel becomes both
    a container for national history and a mode of world literature.

    - surrealist poets, painters, photographers, and filmmakers not only blurred the
    distinctions between the rational and irrational, the conscious and the unconscious,
    dream and waking reality, life and death, but they also subverted the bright line
    of categorical difference separating humans from animals.

    - the idea of cinema as an art is one born of cinephilia.

    - while the term simply means “love of cinema,” cinephilia sets itself apart from
    the average film fan’s love of stars, spectacle, and popular genres, seeking out
    more challenging and complex pleasures.

    - like the art cinema it promotes, cinephilia has long been viewed as a mostly
    euro-american phenomenon, a perception that has obscured rich traditions of film
    appreciation in africa, asia, and latin america and the innovative films they
    have generated.

    henry rainold and henry king (1630s-1650s)."

    - after considering some of the ways that english poets interpolate and describe
    black women through versification, she examines the history of the publication
    of these poems (both in manuscript and print) between the 1630s and 1650s in conjunction

    - finally, she proposes a r examination of the concept of ''consent'' when studying

    - with jane raisch, he is editing christopher marlowe’s works for the 21st-century
    oxford authors series.

    - in addition to his early modern work, he is also collaborating on a digital
    humanities project on the sociology of literary translations in the 19th and 20th
    centuries.

    - he writes: "we know shakespeare’s works as printed books, but reading them sometimes
    also offers us glimpses of other textual media.

    - while we don’t get to see shakespeare’s original manuscripts, we do learn about
    various forms of writing that, around 1600, print was striving to mediate, in
    england as well as elsewhere in europe.

    - his first book be it ever so humble: poverty, fiction, and the invention of
    the middle-class home (u of virginia press, 2013) won the walker cowen prize for
    a study on an eighteenth-century topic.

    - mackenzie has published articles in eighteenth-century fiction , elh , eighteenth-century
    studies , and pmla .

    - reihana’s and fullerton’s approaches are partially archival, drawing directly
    on printed works produced during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
    and highlighting the uncertain line between virtual worlds and augmented archives.

    - both look back to a precise historical period (the 1770’s-1850’s), typically
    associated with urban, industrial and political revolutions in the atlantic as
    well as dramatic changes in visual technology connected to these, including the
    invention of the panorama itself (1787-92).

    - fullerton’s recreation of thoreau’s concord and walden pond is more classical,
    virtual and even cinematic, a paradoxically technological transcendentalism of
    play focused on the observing subject.

    - conversely, reihana’s more explicitly panoramic work about the cook expeditions,
    which emerges from ‘polynesian’ auckland, suggests in its layers and reenactments
    a more distributed and indeed augmented agency in the pacific when compared with
    the ‘atlantic world.’ why walden pond might appear more virtual and a pacific
    island more augmented can be better understood by returning to the archives of
    two print-age pacific expeditions by james cook and george macartney.

    - both men ostensibly failed in their imperial tasks, and yet the printed journals
    and engravings of the expeditions, including the french wallpaper that reihana
    draws upon, became fundamental to new conceptions of nature and empire in the
    late eighteenth century.

    - such media objects indicate the use of a more consciously panoramic approach
    to counter anxiety over erratic failures of mastery and masculinity in a revolutionary
    age.

    - key to the power of reihana’s and fullerton’s interventions is their use of
    archival strategies that return the participant to the disjunctions of the revolutionary
    panoramic, highlighting the uneasy relation between a totalizing technoscientific
    optimism and the archive.

    - he is the author of london: the selden map and the making of a global city,
    1549-1689 (chicago, 2014).

    - with sari gilbert, he created the board game fujian trader (2016) based on his
    discovery of the selden map of china.

    innovative examination of austen and her legacy has garnered praise from publisher''s
    weekly, the times literary supplement, and the new york times.

    - each of these works embodies an iteration of queerness that simultaneously challenges
    the hegemony of reproductive futurism described by theorists leo bersani and lee
    edelman and disavows the utopianist collectivity of much recent queer studies
    scholarship.

    - her first book, economic woman: demand, gender, and narrative closure in eliot
    and hardy (toronto 2012), examines how images of feminized sexuality in the mid-victorian
    realist novel reflected widespread contemporary anxieties about the growth of
    capitalism.

    - kreisel is co-founder of vcologies, an international working group of nineteenth-centuryist
    scholars interested in ecocriticism and environmental studies.

    with jos smith and willson center director nicholas allen, and he is the editor
    of the forthcoming 2018 anniversary edition of mary shelley’s frankenstein from
    oxford university press.

    - it examines objects created by women that made use of a mixture of global sources
    for their material composition and visual inspiration.

    - what kind of alternative stories of empire are told through intercultural crafts?

    - and what tales might unfold around handheld objects in british novels set in
    the eighteenth-century atlantic world?

    - her first book, women, work, and clothes in the eighteenth-century novel , was
    published by cambridge university press in 2013. she is co-editor of the forthcoming

    the campus and the larger athens community.

    - our reading will be accompanied by a slideshow of images drawn from popular
    culture and curated by dr. christopher pizzino.

    - the final 30 minutes of this epic readathon will take place at ciné , just prior
    to a free screening of the bride of frankenstein ( 1935).

    - each scholar will discuss their use of material culture and archival materials
    in their research.

    - featuring: courtney hoffman (georgia tech, english), elizabeth kennison (history),
    sarah mayo (english), alicia wies (english).

    - she has published numerous essays on romantic poetics, women writers, and children’s
    writing, and she is currently completing a manuscript on romantic era prose forms
    for children and working on a book project on musical theater aesthetics and the
    adaptation of children’s books.

    - his work focuses on british literature from 1750-1850, where his research explores
    the role of literature in constructing historical and temporal experience, including
    the uses of antiquity, the anticipation of the future, and practices of reading.

    - he is the author of the poetics of decline in british romanticism (cambridge,
    2018), romantic antiquity: rome in the british imagination, 1789-1832 (oxford,
    2010), and co-author, with the multigraph collective, of interacting with print:
    elements of reading in an era of print saturation (chicago, 2018).

    - in slow violence and the environmentalism of the poor (2011), rob nixon proposes
    a recasting of the glacial as “a rousing, iconic image of unacceptably fast loss.”
    this is a striking formulation, but, while ecologically sensitive critics can
    sympathize both with the urgency and the aims of nixon’s intervention, it overlooks
    how an earlier eighteenth-century and romantic awareness of the increased speed
    and acceleration of contemporary life is already suffused with the recognition
    of an attendant slowness.

    - slow time does create formal problems, as nixon insists, but these formal problems
    are not new.

    - i do not propose to offer an explicit elaboration of slow time per say, nor
    a direct statement of what it does for us as a literary critical concept; instead,
    i seek to approach a sense of what slow time might be and what it might do as
    a critical concept through a series of seven intentionally contradictory propositions.

    - on october 31st uga will take part in frankenreads : an international celebration
    of the 200th anniversary of mary shelley''s frankenstein organized by the keats-shelley
    association of america and the neh.

    - our nearly complete reading of the novel will conclude at ciné, just prior to
    a free screening of the bride of frankenstein ( 1935).

    - a reception with halloween food and fun will begin around 6:00pm.

    - there is no such country, there are no such people.’ wilde’s provocative statement
    makes fun of the fashion for japonisme that was sweeping across europe and north
    america in the late nineteenth century, providing inspiration for artists and
    writers.

    - his denial of the existence of japan is a gesture of cosmopolitan disillusionment:
    in an age of mass tourism and increasingly globalised modernity, distance, desire
    and projection are the only meaningful ways of preserving cultural difference.

    - this paper charts the ‘invention’ of japan in english literature, starting from
    wilde’s aphorism and james mcneill whistler’s pictorial aestheticism.

    - it will explore the construction of japan in the work of the irish writer lafcadio
    hearn, who moved to japan in 1890 and stayed there until his death in 1904. hearn,
    who gave up his british nationality in order to become a naturalised japanese,
    experimented with a style and literary forms that sought to combine the record
    of authentic experience and the aesthetic anti-realism advocated by wilde.

    - stefano evangelista teaches english literature at oxford university.

    - he specializes in british and comparative literature, with a focus on the late

    - this will be a workshop of a pre-circulated paper.

    - she is the co-editor of a special issue for romantic pedagogy commons and has
    published essays and reviews in women’s writing, nineteenth-century gender studies
    , and the keats-shelley journal .

    - how can filmmakers capture the unpredictable unfolding of collective resistance
    when they are often positioned outside the community of striking workers?

    - how does one depict the withholding of labor, which might seem to institute
    a “dead time” in which “nothing happens”?

    - sponsored by the willson center for humanities and arts'' interdisciplinary
    modernism workshop.

    - all attendees are welcome.

    - modsquad workshop graduate student workshop with kaitlin thurlow, english department
    and tara kraft, art history.

    - thurlow and kraft-ainsworth will present in-progress articles for workshop discussion
    and feedback ahead of publication.

    - their papers will be pre-circulated 2 weeks prior to the workshop.

    - in the first half of the workshop dr. elkins will discuss her book, and in the
    second half she will lead the attendees in a hands-on crafts workshop, creating
    eco-printed artists'' books (all craft materials will be supplied).

    - we will pre-circulate a selection from dr. elkins'' book: "introduction: the
    weaver''s handshake," "chapter two: needlecraft feminism" (centered on the modernist
    poet h.d.

    - and her needlework designs), and two examples of short "techne" interchapters
    in which dr. elkins explores her own practice of the crafts she discusses, and
    reflects on how craft can serve as material, method, and theory, expanding the
    modernist archive and the means of engaging it ("techne iii inky depths"; "techne
    vi common threads").

    - dr. elkins will supply a list of craft materials for zoom attendees who would
    like to participate in the hands-on workshop in addition to the opening discussion.

    - book description from the oxford up website: crafting feminism develops a dynamic
    study of craft and art-making in modern and contemporary feminist writing.

    - in evocative readings of literary works from virginia woolf to zadie smith,
    this book expands our sense of transartistic modernist scholarship to encompass
    process-oriented and medium-specific analyses of textile arts, digital design,
    collage, photography, painting, and sculpture in literary culture.

    - by integrating these craft practices into the book''s enlightening archive,
    elkins''s theoretical argument extends a reading of craft metaphors into the material
    present.

    - crafting feminism demonstrates how writers have engaged with handiwork across
    generations and have undertaken the crafting of a new modernity, one that is queer
    and feminist-threaded, messy, shattered, cut-up, pasted together, preserved, repaired,
    reflected, and spun out.

    - an avant-garde work of scholarship, this book interweaves queer research methods
    and interdisciplinary rigor with a series of surprising archival discoveries.

    - making visible the collaborative, creative features of craft, elkins captivates
    readers with generous illustrations and a series of "techne" interchapters-interludes
    between longer chapters, which powerfully convey the symbiosis between feminist
    theory and method, and detail the network of archival influences that underpin
    this volume''s hybrid approach.

    - foregrounding the work of decentering patriarchal and eurocentric legacies of
    artistic authority, elkins champions the diverse, intergenerational history of
    craft as a way to reposition intersectional makers at the heart of literary culture.

    - an original and compelling study, crafting feminism breaks new ground in modernist
    and visual studies, digital humanities, and feminist, queer, and critical race
    theory.

    - begun in 2012, the project has advanced in an aleatory, rhizomatic way.

    - dr. zawacki has invited us to read this blog on the project prior to the workshop:
    https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet-books/2019/04/a-whole-other-system-paris-photo-graff-continued

    - an optional reading will be pre-circulated on the listserv in advance of the
    workshop.

    - his artworks investigate the significance of punjabi traditions in the context
    of south asian disaporic experiences in britain.

    - as timothy brennan argues, postcolonial studies b r i n gs to g e th e r “ g
    lo b a li z ing fea tu r e s of wo r ld histo r y a nd hum a n s o c i e t i e
    s” and “ c oloni a l p rac ti ce s a nd a nti c oloni a l c h a ll e n g e s”.

    - the interdisciplinary approach embraced by postcolonial studies provides a variety
    of academic tools and perspectives to study the social, cultural, and psychological
    aftermath of colonialism and the identity crisis generated in the wake of decolonization.

    - independence efforts in the indian subcontinent following the world war ii as
    well as the grassroots movements targeting colonial regimes in northern africa
    have paved the way towards a rethinking of the power dynamics by challenging eurocentric
    and orientalist ways of defining the other.

    - an important aspect of this critical approach is to scrutinize the dehumanization
    and exploitation of the native under colonial rule (albert memmi, aime cesaire),
    the formation of national consciousness (bill ashcroft et al.

    - ), and the role of violence in establishing sovereign states as well as sovereign
    individuals (fanon).

    - ), it helps evaluate the shifting significations of “home”—for those who cross
    borders to abandon their homes of origin to adopt new ones, as well as those who
    remain in their “natural” homes only to witness significant transformations around
    them.

    - as we enter the 21st century, postcolonial literature and theory helps reinvigorate
    rece nt d e b a t e s on “ w o r ld” a nd “ g lob a l” lit e r a t u res , neocolonialism,
    n e olib e ra lism, decoloniliaty with an eye toward redefining humanism and secularism
    in new contexts.

    - our approaches to these topics are similarly diverse.

    - the department has hosted readings by three prominent irish poets: ciaran carson,
    michael longley, and paul muldoon.

    - the study of rhetoric and composition at the university of georgia provides
    students with a foundational understanding of rhetorical theory, the history of
    rhetoric, composition theory and pedagogy, and rhetorical approaches to literary
    texts.

    - additionally, students can pursue the study of writing within the emerging field
    of electronic textuality and its relation to other areas of study, such as humanities
    computing and literary theory.

    - students who select rhetoric and composition as one of their areas of specialization
    do so with varying purposes: some students seek to supplement their traditional
    literary studies with principles of rhetorical analyses; others wish to prepare
    themselves more fully to teach writing at the secondary or college level; and
    still others aim to pursue an academic career in rhetoric and composition.

    - we are pleased that our students have done well on the job market, taking tenure?track
    jobs at institutions such as the university of mississippi, the university of
    carolina at greensboro, virginia military institute, virginia institute of technology,
    columbus state university, millsaps college, belmont abbey college, and kennesaw
    university.

    - students who elect to pursue the m.a.

    - additionally, students complete an appropriate capstone project, such as a thesis.

    - the topics of recent m.a.

    - theses have ranged from a study of rhetoric and the law in the merchant of venice,
    a examination of rhetorical theory and the novels of tim o''brien, to a rhetorical
    analysis of pharmaceutical advertising.

    - with a concentration in rhetoric and composition should be of interest to students
    who wish to teach at the secondary or college level after obtaining the m.a.

    - or who wish to pursue doctoral studies in rhetoric.

    - students pursuing a ph.d. in english at uga are required to select and to be
    examined on three areas of specialization.

    - the reading list will include standard texts in the history of rhetoric and
    in rhetoric and composition, but it may be shaped to reflect the student''s other
    interests and projected dissertation topic.

    - for instance, past students have combined an interest in historical rhetoric
    and medieval studies, rhetoric and composition and creativity theory, rhetoric
    and african-american literature, feminism and composition, rhetoric and the new
    journalism, composition and creative writing, rhetoric and composition and the
    essay as a genre, rhetoric and composition and romanticism, rhetoric and the twentieth-century
    novel, rhetoric and scientific writing, and rhetoric and electronic textuality.

    - advanced students may also serve as tutors in the uga writing center.

    - although often stereotyped as the “nation’s other,” the south has participated
    in every military conflict since the civil war, and like the nation, has been
    transformed by the rise of cities, multinational corporations, and webbed systems
    of transportation and communication.

    - increasingly, it has interacted - as it always has - with the circumcaribbean,
    through trade, political ruptures and treaties, cultural exchanges, and mutual
    cultural influences, particularly music, art, and dance.

    - as a crucial component of southern culture, southern literature has mapped histories
    of native americans, diasporic africans, colonization, slavery, immigration, agriculture,
    industrialization, and increasingly, urbanization.

    - while the study of southern cultures once was concentrated in literature and
    history, it has expanded to include food studies, climate studies, race and gender
    studies, ethnic studies (especially african american and native studies), queer
    studies, and popular culture, which includes film, television, graphic works,
    music, and digital media.

    - these developments have been absorbed by the “new southern studies,” which has
    generated many new approaches to the u.s. south and its larger configurations
    with the circumcaribbean, the hemisphere, and the atlantic world.

    - critics such as richard gray, patricia yaeger, martyn bone, harriet pollack,
    thadious davis, jose limón, trudier harris, keith cartwright, anna brickhouse,
    gary richards and susan donaldson have put a new slant on the field of southern
    literature.

    - also, the configuration of the u.s. south with the caribbean has brought in
    theoretical perspectives from figures such as édouard glissant, j. michael dash,
    valérie loichot, deborah cohn, and vincent pérez.

    - historians such as david blight, marcus rediker, rebecca j. scott, matthew guterl,
    nell painter, michael trouillot, daniel heath justice, chadwick allen, and rod
    ferguson and others have reshaped our concepts of southern and circumcaribbean
    history.

    - many uga students hail from the south, so this focus on its cultural history
    and heritage comprises a valuable and magnetic mirror, one that reflects the confluences,
    conflicts, and inheritance of a polyglot people.

    - this southern studies concentration thereby offers a valuable foundation for
    negotiations with our nation’s present and futures.

    - sponsored by lamar dodd school of art visiting artist series

    - students frequently write dissertations within a wide array of critical approaches:
    cultural and interdisciplinary studies; feminist criticism and women''s writing;
    formalist and textual analysis; performance studies; folklore; shakespearean and
    other appropriations; and rhetorical approaches to literature.

    - students are encouraged to develop methods and archival research skills appropriate
    to their area of the study, and to draw upon uga’s medieval and early modern strengths
    in departments like history, theater, romance language, and germanic languages.

    - the lively graduate-student-run early modern union of scholars (emus) has organized
    a meeting of the southeastern renaissance conference, while students of earlier
    literatures participate in the georgia medievalists’ group.

    - our graduate students have published in explicator , magistra , renaissance
    papers , the blackwell companion to early modern women''s writing , and shakespeare
    bulletin .

    - research opportunities abound for graduate students of early literatures at

    - philosophy, comparative literature, and romance languages).

    - today, the field is dominated by mark-up languages--the "ml" in html, sgml,
    uml, and xml--the meta-language used to "tag" writing for machine processing (searching,
    display) and thus the crucial new dimension of textual information in the 21st
    century.

    - content, however, is the real object of mark-up.

    - mark-up language is also ly related to "scripting," the specialized form of
    programming by means of which text operations are typically carried out on computers
    and web pages are made to be interactive.

    - programming languages are typically taught in computer science and artificial
    intelligence, while mark up and humanities techniques like “writing for the web”
    are featured in dh.

    - students begin their training with introduction to humanities computing, and
    may then follow their interests in a number of directions including interdisciplinary
    study.

    - notable dh projects in the department include: the linguistic atlas project,
    www.lap.uga.edu < http://www.lap.uga.edu >, the site through which the atlas distributes
    text and audio materials related to american english, especially using gis tools
    dh students will have opportunities to participate in such research, in addition
    to opportunities for teaching experience.

    - english language studies (els) considers the history and present status of the
    english language.

    - study of the english language is an important tool for the study of literature.

    - to paraphrase cs lewis, in the older periods you know what you don''t understand,
    but in more recent periods the apparent similarity of the words of the text to
    contemporary usage can mislead us.

    - words like liberal and conservative, nature and world, require historical perspective
    before we can understand them fully in either the literature of historical periods
    or in the present day, when different authors compete to drive their meanings
    in particular directions.

    - so, too, literature can be an important source of evidence for the study of
    the language across cultures, regions, nations, and time.

    - while students can acquire training in syntax, phonology, and other sub-disciplines
    of linguistics through georgia''s interdepartmental linguistics program, els students
    begin with history of the english language and develop the knowledge and skills
    appropriate for, at the ma level, further study in the language or a literary
    period or commercial jobs that demand control over language.

    - at the doctoral level, students will compete for jobs as "dr. language person"
    in an english department where they can teach and do research in conjunction with
    the work of their colleagues in literature, creative writing, and digital humanities.

    - els at georgia features internationally-prominent research in: language variation,
    especially through the linguistic atlas project, www.lap.uga.edu, the national

    - students work as a cohort between specified dates, but do not meet as a group
    during particular class times, either online or face-to-face.

    - experienced instructors may design a special topics version of fyw that is approved

    - the ultimate goal of service-learning is to promote students'' civic and academic
    learning while contributing to the public good.

    - fyw digital learning labs: park 117, 118, 119 the fyw digital learning labs
    are located on the first floor of the new wing in park hall.

    - lab 118 is open to students and instructors every week day 8:00-5:00 m-f for

    - students must bring their uga id card to lab 118 to check out a laptop.

    - guidelines for writing the introductory reflective essay (rtf) portfolio grading
    rubric (rtf) the portfolio project helps you develop into a proficient writer
    by offering you multiple opportunities to practice and demonstrate to others your
    mastery of writing as an art.

    - in this class, students will write a minimum of three graded papers plus other
    pieces of writing assigned by the teacher.

    - the portfolio will count as 30% of your final grade and will replace the final
    examination as the culminating measure of your achievement in engl 1101 or engl
    1102 this semester.

    - for both students and teachers, portfolios offer many advantages over other
    forms of assessment.

    - first-and probably most important, from the student’s point of view-writers
    gain more control over their writing and therefore over their grades.

    - instead of demonstrating your skill in a single essay, the final examination,
    you will create, select, revise and polish different pieces for the portfolio
    throughout the semester.

    - within boundaries established by the first-year writing program, you select
    the pieces to include in your portfolio; you will have opportunities to consult
    with your teacher and peers about the portfolio’s contents and to revise those
    pieces you choose to include; finally, you will have an opportunity to explain
    the merits of your portfolio as part of the assessment process.

    - for the same reasons, teachers also like this method of evaluation: including
    portfolios in writing assessment allows them to focus on revision, on improvement,
    and on a process of collaboration among student, teacher, and peers.

    - what is in the portfolio?

    - as stated in the fyw handbook , students in the first-year writing program write
    a minimum of three graded papers.

    - for your final assessment, you will compose and submit for evaluation an electronic
    portfolio that includes the following seven components: a biography of the portfolio
    author and, if you like, a picture of yourself or other image.

    - the biography should provide a short introduction to you, the author of the
    portfolio.

    - you may include a photo of yourself or an image that relates to ideas discussed
    in your portfolio.

    - the goal of your biography should be to introduce yourself as a writer .

    - the introductory reflective essay.

    - the most important element in your portfolio, the introductory reflective essay
    (ire) (usually 750-1500 words) ties together all the exhibits in your portfolio;
    it helps you describe and reflect on your writing processes, with your exhibits
    providing the supporting evidence .

    - these pieces provide evidence of your best critical thinking, argumentative
    strategies, prose style, and editing skills.

    - they represent your most “finished” pieces of writing.

    - one revision exhibit that demonstrates your composing process and revision skills.

    - for this exhibit, students typically present a portion of a paper (e.g., a paragraph
    or the thesis statement); and demonstrate the development of this piece of writing
    through several drafts.

    - your task is to clearly show how your writing changed between drafts and to
    include explaining commentary on your revision process to readers.

    - one peer review exhibit that demonstrates your work in reviewing or responding
    to the work of other writers.

    - again, your task is to demonstrate the quality of your work and to explain your
    peer review process.

    - one wild card submission.

    - some students create new exhibits especially to fit with their portfolio theme.

    - in thinking about selecting or creating a wild card, consider how it fits into
    your overall portfolio rationale.

    - while your instructor may have you turn in artifacts to elw for workshopping
    and peer review, you will turn in your final portfolio to elc under "assignments."

    - there are resources describing the process of submitting a portfolio in elc:
    a video and a text document.

    - the first-year writing program at uga introduces 4,500-5,000 students a year
    to college-level academic writing.

    - eportfolios allow students to showcase their best work, to reflect upon their
    own writing practices, and to present their writing in a persuasive manner to
    a range of readers.

    - the uga first year writing program was a member of cohort 2 of the inter/national
    coalition of electronic portfolio research and in 2007 submitted a final report
    to that body.

    - in 2010-2013, the fyw program participated in cohort 6 of the inter/national
    coalition of electronic portfolio research; the research topic was assessment.

    - a collaboration between the uga writing center, division of biology, first-year
    writing, and the writing intensive program, the project involved a study of how
    advanced humanities writers respond to biology lab reports in order to isolate
    science writing knowledge gaps (2018).

    - the first-year writing program uses technology to help students develop their
    written communication.

    - among these tools is elearning for writers (elw).

    - most university students will take english 1101 and 1102 during their first
    year at uga.

    - complete information about placement is available on the "credit from testing"
    page on the registrar’s website .

    - students who earn a score of 3 or 4 on the national advanced language placement
    test in literature receive three hours of credit for english 1101; those who earn
    a score of 5 receive six hours of credit for english 1101 and 1102. all ap equivalencies
    are available on the registrar’s website .

    - 2. the international baccalaureate (ib) program: students who earn a score of
    4, 5, or 6 on the international baccalaureate exam at the high level (hl) in english
    receive three hours of credit for english 1101; those who earn a score of 7 on
    the international baccalaureate exam at the high level (hl) receive six hours
    of credit for english 1101 and 1102. students who earn a score of 5, 6, or 7 on
    the standard level (sl) test receive three hours of credit for english 1101. all
    ib equivalencies are available on the registrar’s website.

    - 3. the departmental placement exam: beginning in fall 2003, students not placed
    by a national placement test will fall into two groups.

    - students with an evidence based reading & writing (formerly known as satv) score
    of 590 and above or an act score of 26 or above will place automatically in engl
    1101 and may register for that class without any further testing; if these students
    choose to do so, they may take the departmental placement exam voluntarily with
    an eye to exempting engl 1101 with three hours of credit.

    - students with an ebrw (formerly known as satv) score of 580 or below are required
    to take the departmental placement exam before registering for a first-year writing
    class.

    - specific information about the departmental english placement exam can be found
    at the testing services website''s page on the exam.

    - the departmental english placement test consists of two parts, mechanics and
    rhetoric.

    - a score of 22 (part 1) and 20 (part 2) will place students in english 1102 and
    give them three hours of credit for english 1101. students whose test scores indicate
    that they might have trouble in english 1101 will write an essay to determine
    whether they will be advised to take english 1101 or an academic enhancement class.

    - students should take the test at a first-year orientation session.

    - those who miss the test at orientation may take it later at university testing
    services in clark howell hall.

    - however, the test is not open to students who have taken or are currently enrolled
    in first-year writing here or elsewhere.

    - for more information, please call (706) 542-3183 or visit the university testing
    service website .

    - because writing skills develop slowly over time and because in-class activities
    are crucial to the discussion-based format of the class and its community-building
    mission, students’ regular attendance is important in first-year writing.

    - instructors are neither required nor expected to re-teach material covered in
    class to students who were absent.

    - students who encounter a severe situation will only have those absences excused
    if the instructor receives notification of the situation from uga’s office of
    student care and outreach at the time of the situation.

    - it is the responsibility of the student to have sco send a message to their
    instructor verifying the severity of the situation.

    - beyond what is described above, the only other excused absences are those listed
    under uga policy 4.06, jury duty, military service, and religious observances.

    - students incur no grade penalties for un-excused absences 1-6 (for classes that
    meet mwf) or un-excused absences 1-4 (for mw and tth classes).

    - it is the instructor’s responsibility to judge work and assign grades.

    - consequently, students with questions about final grades should first discuss
    those questions with their instructors.

    - if the problem cannot be resolved in discussion, students may prepare a grade
    appeal in writing according to the new guidelines established by the franklin
    college bylaws, article v. you may view the franklin college bylaws on the college
    website .

    - the appeal to the instructor should contain a cover letter explaining the grounds
    for the appeal, and providing all relevant supporting documentation.

    - 3) if, after appealing to the instructor, the student is not satisfied, they
    may appeal to the fyw program director, per department of english bylaws.

    - the university assigns certain grades that are not computed in the grade point
    average.

    - the incomplete (“i”) is one of these.

    - fyw teachers must obtain permission from the fyw office before assigning an
    "i."

    - a copy of this document must be filed in the fyw office along with a signed
    grade change from.

    - students who receive incompletes may have no longer than three semesters to
    complete all remaining work satisfactorily.

    - instructors can require that students complete work in a shorter period of time.

    - if an “i” is not removed after three terms (including summer), it changes to
    an “f.” incompletes are assigned sparingly and at the discretion of the instructor
    and the director of the first-year writing program when a small amount of essential
    work remains.

    - teachers teach computing, whereas computing education researchers discover what
    is true about the teaching and learning of computing, and invent new techniques
    for teaching and assessing it (some pedagogical, some computational).

    - in cer, the term "computing" is broadly defined: it''s not just about programming,
    or even just about computer science, but also about all of the phenomena surrounding
    computing (including privacy, security, information ethics, software engineering,
    etc.).

    - this means that computing education and computing education research can and
    does cover far more than just learning to code.

    - we are particularly interested in active learning, peer learning, computer-aided
    learning, open educational resources, and assessment.

    science to a school of computing.

    - computational intelligence in conjunction with the artificial intelligence center,
    several studies in computational intelligence have been conducted.

    - genetic algorithms and simulation are used to find good (in many cases near-optimal)
    solutions to hard problems that are intractable using traditional techniques.

    - examples include: multiple fault diagnosis, battlefield communication network
    configuration, chromosome reconstruction, edge detection, equation development
    for describing relationships in complex data, and the snake-in-the-box problem.

    - computer networks networks are becoming increasingly complex as the needs for
    speed, bandwidth, robustness, and security increase.

    - examples of recent studies include asymmetric protocol modifications for streaming
    media and network storages, scalable online game servers, and network-based anti-spam
    systems.

    - computational genetics recently, a number of technical advances in molecular
    biology, such as cloning and sequencing dna fragments, have resulted in a new
    approach to genetics.

    - where traditionally genetics has proceeded from a phenotype to a dna fragment
    (gene), the new genetics with its molecular tools often proceeds in reverse: from
    an anonymous dna fragment to its biochemical function (phenotype).

    - our research in this area has concentrated on developing an information system
    for the genome mapping.

    - the system, called fungal genome database (fgdb), used to create and store maps
    of of fungi (initially nidulans) is under development.

    - also, we are interested in developing new algorithms and computational methods
    in various areas of genetic mapping.

    - bioinformatics and health informatics biology is increasingly considered to
    be a data-intensive discipline, replacing earlier hypothesis-driven and lab oriented
    approaches.

    - a large mass of experimental data (e.g., genomic data at sequencing center,
    proteomic and glycomics data generated using high throughput experiments) is being
    generated by the academic and commercial institutions.

    - computational and informatics approaches are needed to identify features in
    the dna sequences, to suggest hypotheses as to the function of specific sequences,
    or to develop new pathways.

    - the research in bioinformatics by the computer science community at uga mainly
    involves algorithms; models; visualization; data integrations; information systems
    (including mining and knowledge discovery); and high performance computing for
    computational problems in biology through collaborations with biologists.

    - researchers at computer science depeartment are significant parts of several
    large centers and multidisciplinary projects.

    - artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is the computer modeling of
    intelligent behavior, including but not limited to modeling the human mind.

    - we see it as an interdisciplinary field where computer science intersects with
    philosophy, psychology, linguistics, engineering, and other fields.

    - example areas of ai expertise at uga include natural language processing, logical
    reasoning and decision making, evolutionary computing, neural networks, robotics,
    intelligent information systems, vision, and expert systems to name a few.

    - combinatorial analysis of discrete structures is important in analyzing algorithms
    as well as in understanding the properties of the discrete structures themselves.

    - established research at uga in this area has focussed on issues in complexity
    theory concerning exact (parameterized) and approximation algorithms; exact and
    asymptotic combinatorial enumeration; structural studies; loop-free algorithms;
    and graph algorithms.

    - recent studies have expanded to include randomized combinatorial algorithms,

    - abstract: in the era of "big data", when we design mining and retrieval models
    for large data (e.g., in the order of billions of nodes/documents) to extract
    knowledge and patterns, the scalability and efficiency of the models are of critical
    importance.

    - intuitively, as dataset size increases, the models should not just be effective,
    but must be fast and scalable also (i.e., run-time speed of the models when applied
    to very large amount of data).

    - traditional mining and retrieval models tend to get more and more costly to
    sustain reasonable run-time speed on large data.

    - i will illustrate how to achieve highly effective mining and retrieval results
    on massive data, without incurring too much additional computational latency and
    costs.

    - an implication of this work is that now we can handle large data more elegantly
    -- maintaining good mining and retrieval effectiveness, without sacrificing run-time
    efficiency on massive data or requiring too much additional computational and
    energy resources, thus offering a more attractive and cost-effective solution
    for mining and retrieval on massive data.

    - abstract: over the past decade, we are experiencing big data challenges in various
    research domains.

    - the data nowadays involve an increasing number of data types that need to be
    handled differently from conventional data records, and an increasing number of
    data sources that need to be fused together.

    - taming data variety issues is essential to many research fields, such as biomedical
    research, social computing, neuroscience, business intelligence, etc.

    - the data variety issues are difficult to solve because the data usually have
    complex structures, involve many different types of information, and multiple
    data sources.

    - specially, i will describe a network alignment method which exploit heterogeneous
    information to align the user accounts across different social networks.

    - i will model the functional brain networks as uncertain graphs, and describe
    a sub graph mining approach to extract important linkage patterns from the uncertain
    graphs.

    - i''ll also introduce future work in this direction and explain some possibilities
    for upcoming evolutions in big data research.

    as well as the drastic transformations in computer architecture open up exciting
    opportunities for research in parallel computing.

    - i will present performance improvements obtained by the use of our solver for
    nuclear structure computations.

    - sparse matrix computations and eigenvalue problems arise in various fields of
    contexts, such as graph analytics and machine learning among others, but people
    working in these fields are not necessarily parallel programming experts.

    - the goal here is to leverage the extensive computational and experimental data

    explosive growth of data in biological research, and countless other fields of
    study, has fueled investigation into distributed pattern recognition techniques.

    - some of these techniques involve inference over undirected graphs that are too
    large for analysis on a single machine (millions to billions of vertices).

    - graphs are a convenient way of organizing this data, and the eigenvalues and
    eigenvectors of the graph can yield important insights into the evolution of the
    network and diffusion of information across it.

    - first, we examine smaller networks built from motion parameters derived by recognizing
    and quantifying the motion depicted in digital videos of ciliary biopsies.

    - cilia are microscopic hairlike structures that beat in synchronized patterns
    to move particulates and nutrients in the throat, lungs, kidneys, and brain.

    - automated recognition of the specific type of ciliary motion is an important
    problem in clinical diagnostics.

    - finally, we look at these analytics in practice using the oak ridge biosurveillance
    toolkit (orbit) to monitor a multitude of web services, such as , , and , and
    observe the dynamics of public health in real-time, identify health-related threats
    as they emerge, and discover novel spatio-temporal correlations in the evolution
    and spread of disease.

    - refreshments will be served at 9:30 a.m. in room 409, boyd gsrc abstract: in
    biomedical research, availability of an increasing array of high-throughput and
    high-resolution instruments have given rise to large datasets of imaging data
    - such as whole-slide histology microscopy imaging.

    - these datasets provide highly detailed views of tissue structures at the cellular
    level and present a strong potential to revolutionize biomedical translational
    research.

    - however, traditional human-based pathology review is not feasible to obtain
    this wealth of imaging information due to the overwhelming data scale and unacceptable
    inter- and intra-observer variability.

    - equipped with statistical machine learning techniques, these systems can automatically
    detect, measure, group, and classify a large scale of anatomical structures, such
    as cells, from microscopy images of histological specimens to support higher-level
    diagnosis and follow-up scientific investigations.

    - i will also illustrate my work on brain tumor translational research with multi-scale,
    multi-platform in silico experiments, involving execution of image processing
    algorithms on microscopy image datasets, extraction and management of in-situ
    micro-anatomical imaging features, and correlation of heterogeneous data types
    and sources.

    - for data integrative investigations, phenotypic signatures from histopathology
    imaging data are synergized with patient molecular profiles, and clinical outcome,
    exhibiting a novel avenue to better patient stratification protocols and an improved
    understanding of brain pathophysiology.

    - biography: jun kong is a senior research scientist in the department of biomedical
    informatics at emory university.

    - he has developed computer-aided diagnosis (cad) systems for analyzing a large

    - the science of security: ensuring secure collaboration munindar p. singh north
    carolina state university abstract : despite sustained research effort in security,
    current security practice conveys a decidedly ad hoc flavor---find a bug; patch
    it; find the next bug; and so on.

    - this methodology is sometimes termed "engineering", using the term in the narrow
    sense of developing solutions to specific problems.

    - the past few years have seen a growing push to develop a science of security
    (sos), viewed as a systematic body of knowledge with strong theoretical and empirical
    underpinnings that inform the engineering of secure information systems.

    - i introduce sos, briefly describing its key elements.

    - i then motivate some of the foundational challenges of sos from the standpoint
    of systems of autonomous participants, sometimes termed "systems of systems".

    pu georgia institute of technology abstract : the ongoing convergence of evolution
    of devices (internet of things), deployment of large shared infrastructures (computing
    clouds), and accumulation of big data (sensors and social networks) has created
    exciting new research challenges.

    - we will describe some of these challenges in the three phases of disaster management:
    preparedness beforehand, emergency response, and recovery afterwards.

    - with concrete scenarios, e.g., using for effective information exchange during
    emergencies, we will discuss the research challenges in quality of service (e.g.,
    real-time response time, high availability and robustness despite widespread failures),
    and quality of information (e.g., security, privacy, and robustness despite misinformation).

    - these research challenges require integration and synthesis of results from
    several related areas, e.g., sensor networks and social networks as big data producers,
    and sophisticated models running on clouds as big data consumers.

    - we will use a concrete multi-hazard scenario (landslides) to illustrate these
    research challenges and some promising solutions.

    - abstract: modern content management systems make it easy to build web-based
    repositories or digital libraries.

    - such systems often allow the user to create new content types consisting of
    any number of named fields; the fields might contain simple values (attributes),
    references to other content type instances (relationships), or references to files.

    - even when using the same content management system, repositories can differ
    in structure: some repositories may have a single content type (e.g.,resource)
    with associated metadata fields (e.g., dublin core metadata fields).

    - other repositories may define multiple content types, connected by relationships.

    - our approach begins with the definition of small schema fragments that we call
    domain structures, where the domain structure describes (just) what is needed
    to support a widget of interest.

    - for example, in order to support a hierarchical navigation widget, we use a
    domain structure with one entity (resource) with a single attribute (title), with
    a recursive relationship (part-of) that relates resources.

    - given a domain structure, we ask domain-savvy end-users to define simple correspondences
    from the components of the domain structure to their local structure.

    - in effective, we seek to support end-user schema mapping.

    - we have implemented these ideas in the drupal content management system; we
    host several educational repositories with generic widgets that support navigation,
    (selective) cloning and downloading.

    - we have extended this work by defining a domain structure that supports dynamic,
    compound faceted browsing for repositories with simple structure.

    - we envision using our technology over a set of sites (e.g., endpoints) using
    semantic web technology.

    georgia and country are.

    - today we stand at the brink of groundbreaking advancements in ai.

    - technologies like machine learning and large language models (llms) are already
    revolutionizing research worldwide—from advancing protein design and discovering
    new planets in deep space to generating new forms of art, music and creative activity.

    - as ai continues to evolve, uga has an important mission ahead: to balance its
    ethical and societal implications to ensure it serves humanity as a whole.

    - what will the next forty years bring?

    - as we delve deeper into the wonders of ai, new opportunities will arise to elevate
    our curiosities and ambitions.

    - using robotics to help sort onions on georgia farms wednesday, march 27, 2024
    - 8:55am image: during the pandemic, labor problems became acute on many farms
    in georgia and across the country.

    - farms once staffed by humans to bring produce from the field to stores for purchase
    were suddenly short-staffed, and the global supply chain was severely impacted.

    - working with uga’s vidalia onion and vegetable research center , a unit of the
    college of agricultural and environmental sciences , and a&m farms in lyons, georgia,
    they have tested a robotic arm in the task of sorting fresh vidalia onions from
    those suffering blemishes.

    - combining a robotic arm with cameras and an ai trained to recognize the good
    and bad produce, the system can pick up onions, view it, and sort the good from
    the bad.

    - the project has shown progress in a type of task known as “pick-inspect-place.”
    robots in agriculture or manufacturing have long been involved in picking and
    placing tasks.

    - here, researchers have added the element of inspecting using computer vision,
    as well.

    - “there are basically two ai models,” said prasanth suresh, a doctoral student
    on the project.

    - “there’s one that teaches the robot the behavior and one that detects the object
    using vision.

    - the second ai model will detect the object and instruct the proper behavior—r
    inspection for blemishes on good onions or throwing blemished onions in the waste.”
    the idea, doshi said, is not to eliminate these professions for human workers,
    but to provide options, protect the job from labor shortages and to upskill workers
    into positions that require less strenuous conditions.

    - “often, these workers work through high heat, dust, or other conditions,” he
    said.

    - “we are not trying to replace this worker.

    - … ai has suffered from a little bit of a perception issue.

    - if you ask core ai researchers, their goal is not necessarily to design an ai
    that acts like a human, but to design rational agents that act optimally given
    the knowledge they have.” suresh and doshi are joined by doctoral student ehsan
    asali on the project, all featured in this video.

    - the category 4 hurricane is approaching.

    - should a potentially affected individual follow the official orders and evacuate,
    or stay in place?

    - millions of individuals situated in vulnerable areas face this grave question
    as imminent disaster threatens.

    - many choose to leave, whereas some do not.

    - those individuals who choose to stay put have ostensibly made a sub-rational
    decision, with serious ramifications both for themselves and for first responders
    and other officials charged with serving them.

    - yet, numerous interviews with such persons clearly convey their conviction in
    having made the right choice.

    - this project will identify the variables that significantly influence the decision
    making of individuals in impending disaster areas, and it will contribute to our
    understanding of how the variables are utilized differently by different individuals.

    - these insights will help to build new computational models of the individual’s
    decision making under uncertainty, in extreme situations such as hurricanes and
    other natural disasters.

    - the focus disasters will be the impacts of hurricane harvey on the texas coast
    and hurricane irma on florida and georgia.

    - the time-sensitive nature of potentially useful data makes its collection urgent.

    - the insights and predictions generated by this systematic data-driven investigation
    could have significant impact on government and society.

    - it could augment evacuation efforts with actions on the ground that target those
    most likely to ignore official recommendations.

    - furthermore, such modeling will likely help relief-and-rescue efforts to better
    coordinate and provide faster relief with better precision.

    collective, and the willson center for the arts and humanities, the georgia colloquium
    on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century british literature hosted a talk by dr.
    stephanie degooyer from the university of north carolina-chapel hill.

    - navitski and rosenbaum gave short presentations on beat film and poetry.

    - this conversation followed kelli connell''s november 19th lecture at lamar dodd
    school of art about her current solo exhibition at the high museum, "pictures
    for charis."

    - in june 2024, richard menke presented the wolff keynote lecture at the conference
    of the research society for victorian periodicals (rsvp) in sterling, scotland.

    - his talk, "victorian media and the places of serial modernity,” considered how
    victorian periodicals not only treated serial print culture as part of what it
    meant to be modern but also drew on serial publication to imagine the relationship
    of contemporary life to a future that was bound to appear right on schedule.

    - we learn through reading, talking to each other, writing, and teaching.

    - also perfect was our keynote speaker.

    - in recognition of this endowment, park 265, the large lecture hall, will be
    named in commemoration of doug hale, who earned both a ba and ma in english and
    taught english literature in several colleges and universities before embarking
    on a stellar career in television and film.

    - a decade ago doug returned to park hall on one of his annual trips here (he
    was a native athenian) and gave a memorable talk in that very room, one soon to
    be named the hale lecture hall.

    - as author of a recent history of dada, i’ve been giving talks on the subject
    across the country to standing room only audiences, and wondering what it is that
    compels such interest in this relentlessly iconoclastic movement.

    - in 1962, the year before he died, he gave a talk at dartmouth college called
    “on extravagance.” by extravagance he meant that little twist artists give to
    the raw material provided by the world, the twist of as if.

    - much of the talk is just frost reading his poems, albeit with the startling
    disclosure that they’re “just loaded, loaded, with politics.” really?—by the author
    of “birches,” “mending wall,” “stopping by woods on a snowy evening”?

    - talking to parents of my students afterward was a special treat, and one of
    them observed that nearly all the students were women.

    - i’m not an expert on the visual representations of their likenesses, and more
    to the point, i’m not an expert on classical statuary.

    - during 2017, for example, thirty of our faculty members went to approximately
    85 conferences, where they not only presented their own research, but also learned
    from presentations from their peers.

    - professor cynthia camp attended a specialized seminar, “understanding the medieval
    book,” in medieval codicology at the university of south carolina.

    - in a future newsletter, we will also introduce and formally welcome two, additional
    recent hires: joshua kuyrkendall (facilities coordinator) and dr. joshua king
    (lecturer), serving as interim associate direct of first-year composition.

    - we also memorialized our large classroom, park 254, as the doug hale lecture
    hall in recognition of the gift of his widow, mary anne hale.

    - occasionally, a professor would lecture on contemporary literature, or “belles
    lettres,” as it was known at the time, but until the turn of the century, uga’s
    “english” professors had no community of either colleagues or students.

    - the faculty and students in the department of english enact these commitments
    of care—they may be in the form of philanthropy (please read about professor emerita
    elizabeth kraft’s newly endowed scholarship to students) or in the forms of scholarship
    that enliven new conversations about historical and national periods (see the
    feature on dr. rodrigo paula martini) or in the form of welcoming scholars to
    campus to discuss the relations between racial representations and cultural productions
    (see the feature on dr. joshua hussey).

    - fall semester will also welcome new faculty members: joshua hussey and emily
    robinson, who have been hired as lecturers to assist primarily with the first-year
    writing program.

    - and as a co-director of uga’s colloquium in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
    literature since 2011, she helped to bring an impressive roster of scholars to
    campus, where they interacted ly with both faculty and students.

    - the day will with a keynote address from elizabeth pastan (emory).

    - dr. alexander earned his phd in english rhetoric and composition from the university
    of louisville in 2010 and joined our department as a lecturer in 2011. among other
    things, he frequently taught courses in technical and professional communication.

    - in october, the georgia colloquium in eighteenth and nineteenth-century british
    literature hosted dr. nasser mufti (university of illinois-chicago), a highly
    regarded expert on the intersections between nineteenth-century british literature
    and postcolonial studies.

    - dr. mufti gave a fascinating and well-attended talk on “the victorians at decolonization,”
    which was followed by a lively reception.

    - the colloquium in eighteenth and nineteenth-century british literature is co-directed
    by david diamond and casie legette, and supported by the willson center and the
    rodney baine lecture fund.

    - they have regular speakers, such as dr. lasek-white, who gave an in-depth presentation
    about career preparation and professionalization.

    brought from africa to america" and a workshop with coles and dr. david diamond
    (uga), on early printed books in the uga special collections libraries, including
    our first edition of wheatley peters'' poems (1773).

    - the symposium, sponsored by the willson center, departments of english and romance
    languages, the office of institutional diversity, the institutes for african american
    studies and for women''s studies, and the bibliographical society of america,
    featured a keynote address by acclaimed artist suzanne coley and a panel with
    special guest professor jennifer low (florida atlantic university), an early modern
    scholar and apprentice book artist.

    and african american textiles, investigating gender, race, and memory through
    exquisitely sewn, embroidered, and printed books.

    - david lumpkin ’s short story “the dying person,” written for professor aruni
    kashyap’s fall 2022 creative writing seminar, appeared in the summer 2023 issue
    of story magazine .

    - a simple moment that was formative early on in my graduate study was an exchange
    with our beloved dr. d. her “shakespeare, media, and appropriation” class was
    my very first seminar, and in the first week we had what felt like a month’s worth
    of reading compared to what i was accustomed to as an undergraduate.

    - fredric dolezal delivered this year’s annual invited lecture of the helsinki
    society for historical lexicography on may 12, 2023, on his recent discovery of
    an intriguing copy of john wilkins’s essay towards a real character and a philosophical

    manuscript notes that show a reading and engagement with the lexicographic content
    of the print artifact.

    georgia highlands writers conference.

    interdisciplinary conference at the university of tennessee, knoxville, and the

    - dr. lavender has been invited to give a lecture in arles, france at the 3rd
    edition of the “realities of science fiction symposium” hosted by luma arles from
    december 15-17, 2023. barbara mccaskill continued her leadership with drs.

    - she gave a talk about her book at the athens-clarke county library and was joined
    by aaron meskin, professor of philosophy, to converse about how muslim comics
    illustrate the multifaceted nature of seeing and representing daily lives within
    and outside of the homeland.

    - managing the mail, stocking office supplies, and scanning entire manuscripts
    is just a fraction of her duties; she also aids the creative writing department
    by organizing events with authors and lecturers, and provides planning, logistical,
    and creative support.

    - she grows animated as she talks about the linguistic impacts of the norman conquest,
    which transformed upper-levels of english society into a multilingual aristocracy.

    - or a cat’s footprint as they walked over fresh ink while stalking mice.

    - he remembers “lovely” receptions, brilliant keynote speakers, and christina
    garcia speaking to a “full house” at the uga chapel.

    - that love was one of his deciding factors for accepting a position at uga: “one
    of the reasons i came here is that my real love in literature is african american
    literature, and when i first came here, we had a really great representation in
    the department.” while he has published numerous titles, dr. lowe pinpoints calypso
    magnolia: the crosscurrents of caribbean and southern literature as the “big book”
    of his career, and the most personally significant writing project is the biography
    of ernest j. gaines that he has been writing for ten years.

    - using an old photographic image from an obscure spanish photographer, i offered
    this to the humanities center at the university of oregon for a talk i was giving

    legette, senior lecturer nancee reeves, and humanities internship and career coordinator
    christine lasek-white, this event featured ten graduates who were accompanied
    by over 50 friends and family members.

    - for example, he brought in scholars that he knew to give talks to the department
    and mingle with the students.

    - “i was always self conscious just standing in the halls talking to people.

    - dr. king designs the course so that the “[video] games are happening alongside
    more traditional academic texts,” and students begin to see how both texts and
    video games construct meaning and “work as rhetoric.” he uses the stanley parable
    to “talk about how choice works” in game design and writing.

    - that it’s really sophisticated and complex.” instructors should “[find] new
    ways of talking about [writing and rhetoric]” because it “keeps us limber and
    keeps us more aware of how texts we’re surrounded by work.” students “think about
    rhetoric a little differently, maybe even a little bit more broadly after taking
    a class with a weird focus.” defamiliarizing the first year writing classroom
    allows students to realize that rhetoric is built into everything we experience.

    - virtual and in-person events during spring semester 2023 included lectures by
    dr. kim coles and dr. vincent carretta (both of the university of maryland), a
    webinar examining archival holdings connected to wheatley in the american antiquarian

    special collections library, roundtables featuring national and international
    scholars of american and british literature, and a tour of eighteenth-century
    holdings in princeton university’s “object lessons” traveling exhibit at the georgia
    museum of art.

    - the goal of these events and activities has been to bring attention to wheatley’s
    literary productions beyond her book publication; to consider how and why representations
    of wheatley have evolved and shifted over time and across generations; to make
    visible her activism and agency both within slavery and as a wife, mother, and
    published author in freedom; to gain greater understanding of her influence on
    transatlantic and diasporic literature; and to emulate wheatley’s artistic networks
    by creating a contemporary community of fans of the poet that bridges academic
    and nonacademic audiences.

    - zack anderson presented his paper "translator/transducer: definition, fidelity,
    and translation in the ursonates" at the louisville conference on literature and

    - she has begun working on her first monograph, tentatively titled "representations
    of books and readers in early modern english drama."

    - this talk will draw from her current work on race, religion, and gender in the
    early modern transatlantic, with specific reference to phillis wheatley peters
    and white christianity.

    - the symposium on the book presents a talk by dr. asheesh kapur siddique titled
    "documenting the body of state: paper and the archive of early american constitutionalism."

    - in this talk, dr. siddique argues that the mode of constitution-making inaugurated
    in the aftermath of the american revolution represented not an invention of written
    constitutionalism, but instead a revision of the relationship between document
    and statecraft in early modern europe.

    - this lecture and discussion adds an unexpected dimension to our ongoing conversations
    about the early american constitution by considering the paper on which these
    foundational documents were written and printed -- and how and where these conversations
    were preserved.

    - between the presentations of drs.

    - this two-day event unites talks from book historians and practicing book artists,

    of georgia and a former resident artist at penland school of craft.

    - this talk will feature book related highlights from the program trips in oxford,
    london, rome, and cortona."

    - my talk will explore some of these remediations and show how their efforts to
    create a sense of immediacy in presenting their content to the reader brought
    into focus, and also defamiliarized, the medium of print itself."

    - in a 1780 parliamentary speech, “on economical reform,” edmund burke asserts
    that the british royal household “has lost all that was stately and venerable
    in the antique manners, without retrenching anything of the cumbrous charge of
    a gothic establishment” and is populated by “grim spectres of departed tyrants—the
    saxon, the norman, and the dane; the stern edwards and fierce henries—who stalk
    from desolation to desolation, through the dreary vacuity, and melancholy succession
    of chill and comfortless chambers.” the proposed reforms that burke introduced
    with that speech included efforts to replace the household as personal institution
    with modern impersonal systems of governance.

    - this talk will argue that ann radcliffe’s narratives (particularly the mysteries
    of udolpho ) enact a kind of household reform/modernization that is homologous
    to what burke pursues, and that also catches the oikos /household in its transmutation
    from a slightly-less-figural component of pre- and proto-capitalist systems (which
    in many respects actually were households) to the deep oikos metaphor in the circuitry
    of full-fledged capitalist for which home might be a better synonym.

    - a number of contemporary digital media works, such as lisa reihana’s installation
    “in pursuit of venus [infected]/emissaries” (2015-2017) and tracy fullerton’s
    video game “walden” (2017), have returned to panoramic strategies of representation
    to reimagine totalizing and seemingly transcendent concepts like empire and nature.

    - this lecture is free and open to the public.

    - the question of how (or why, or whether) to commingle queer theory and ecocriticism
    has become an urgent concern for many theorists writing in the wake of timothy
    morton’s 2010 pmla essay “queer ecology.” while greg garrard, for example, thinks
    that queer theory needs ecocriticism in order to avoid theoretical bankruptcy
    and irrelevance, jordy rosenberg argues exactly the opposite, warning that certain
    versions of eco-theory are guilty of promulgating “a primitivist fantasy that
    hinges on the violent erasure of the social: the conjuring of a realm—an ‘ancestral
    realm’—that exists in the present, but in parallax to historical time.” this talk
    will develop rosenberg''s analysis by taking up the question of eco-queer futurity
    in three emblematic victorian texts: emily bronte’s 1847 novel wuthering heights
    , matthew arnold’s 1867 poem “dover beach,” and gerard manley hopkins’s “binsey
    poplars” (1879).

    - this talk will aim to demonstrate how eco-queer readings of these works can
    illuminate the clashing temporal and spatial scales at work in their deep logic,
    and thereby draw out their conflicted investment in nascent ideologies of economic
    and environmental stewardship.

    - she has published articles in pmla , victorian studies , representations, and
    elh , and is currently at work on a new book on the history of the sustainability
    concept and utopianism in the nineteenth century.

    - this event is sponsored by the willson center for humanities and arts along
    with the colloquium on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century british literature

    - this talk looks at how handmade artifacts enabled connections with british colonial
    spaces in imaginative, material, and tactile ways.

    - my talk takes up these questions by looking at the 1808 novel the woman of colour
    and its treatment of small things, such as miniature portraits, jewelry, and needlework,
    to study how portable goods, especially those carried by women, underwrite its
    representation of empire, the circulation of goods, and the narrative meanings
    that adhere to movement across the atlantic.

    - they might better be understood as eighteenth-century problems whose terms and
    contours, whose representational experiments we can recognize especially in the
    later years of the century.

    - working off of nixon and contemporary historians and social theorists like reinhart
    koselleck, hartmut rosa, paul virilio and jonathan crary, all of whom posit experiences
    of acceleration as central to what we often call modernity, the talk proposes
    a fraught and productive relationship between speed and slowness as characteristic
    of temporal experience in the eighteenth century and beyond.

    dead weight": sugar, literature, and anti-slavery material culture," a lecture
    by a 2019 franklin visiting fellow, dr. patricia matthew (associate professor,
    montclair state university) when british abolitionists called for a sugar boycott
    in the late 1790s, they pointed to women as key to the campaign''s success.

    - the reasons for this are complex, and in this talk dr. matthew explores this
    complexity by linking poetry and fiction by regency-era women writers to the material
    representations of england''s debates about slavery and the slave trade.

    - a reception in the robert west library, park hall 261 will follow dr. matthew''s

    - as a pivotal tool of twentieth- and twenty-first century labor resistance, the
    strike has long been a vital topic for political cinema, even as it pushes the
    limits of filmic representation.

    - examining case studies from brazil, france, and beyond, this workshop presentation
    explores the cinematic construction of strike time as a radical break with the
    temporality of the working day that opens up new possible futures.

    - presentation by sarah ann wells (university of wisconsin-madison).

    - a prose-photography hybrid, paris photo graff interlaces its author’s black
    and white images of wall scrawl from the french capital with episodic meditations
    on open-source literary communities and semi-hidden subcultures, the commercialization
    of street art, the hermeneutics of rumor and secrecy, authorial absence and self-presentation,
    the social relation of graffiti to political change, and the history of documenting
    graffiti with a camera.

    - contextualized by the new york tagging scene of the late 1970s and drawing on
    the critical work of lisa robertson and daniel tiffany, craig castleman and early
    baudrillard, this talk and photo screening will consider the poetics of contemporary
    parisian graffiti as a paradoxical enactment of both subliminal exclusivity and
    vernacular inclusion.

    - the interdisciplinary modernisms workshop is delighted to host her for a presentation
    and discussion of her forthcoming book, militarized visualities .

    - this lecture takes up the work of contemporary artist, hardeep pandhal.

    - we teach courses on historical periods and genres together with seminars on

    including (to name some of the most recent) "the kafkaesque," "urban modernity,"
    "impressionism in england," "modernism and the aristocracy," "britain between
    the wars," "victorian femininity, nationhood, and the black atlantic," "patriotism
    and victorian poetry," "contemporary irish poetry," and "literature, media, and
    information in the nineteenth century."

    the historiography of the history of rhetoric; antifoundationalism and rhetorical
    theory; burke, booth, bakhtin, and literary analysis; markup technologies and
    the rhetorical canons; rhetoric, law, and literature.

    - advanced students can serve as support tas for large lecture sections of sophomore
    literature as well as for the "gateway" undergraduate course, "introduction to
    english studies," and then as teacher of record for smaller sections of the sophomore
    courses.

    - medieval and early modern studies at the university of georgia is a central
    pillar of british and irish studies, material textualities, and theories of cultural
    representation at uga.

    - graduate seminars vary from traditional, author-based surveys (beowulf, shakespeare,
    milton) to special topics (“chaucer and everything after,” “the early modern body,”
    “shakespeare and appropriation”); students can also train in early languages of
    the british isles (old english, middle english, middle welsh) while pursuing theoretical
    approaches (“performance theory,” “shakespeare and feminist theory”).

    - these strengths are reflected in our course offerings, such as recent seminars
    on specific critical movements (e.g.

    - the english department provides additional support for this area of study by
    sponsoring reading groups and by hosting lectures by eminent theorists including,
    in the last few years, johanna drucker, stanley fish, michael hardt, linda hutcheon,
    fredric jameson, and rei terada.

    word for five times again?)

    - beyond making an impression, we aim to use this event to build a sustainable
    community for lovers of art in uga and athens at large!

    - the interdisciplinary modernisms research cluster (aka the modsquad), co-directed

    - in fall 2024, the undergraduate english association, or uea, provided the community
    of park hall with light-hearted recreation, community-building events, and genuine
    friendships.

    - yet this singular event has revealed yet another strength of an english department:
    the care and solicitation our professors have for students who are bewildered,
    dismayed, afraid, or outright grieving over the results.

    - by the time commencement ceremonies were underway around campus, the usual cornucopia
    of blooms was long past.

    - and once again, the english department commencement marked the passage of another
    graduating class.

    - of the fifty-four who participated in the ceremony, there were only five guys
    (which, coincidentally, is the name of a burger joint downtown across from the
    arch of countless photo-ops).

    - of our forty-eight 4000 level courses this spring, only four had gender parity,
    while seventeen of them had a ten to one ratio.

    - i’d like to end on an uplifting note, but public events are shouting louder
    than a head’s column can aspire to.

    - professor maggie zurawski participated in the week-long paros poetry and translation
    symposium.

    - this year, they focused on the theme of “writing for a better world,” and hosted
    in-person or virtual speakers to address writing pedagogy the creative writing
    program also supported student writers by hosting a “2 students + 2 alumni: a
    creative writing program reading” event, as well as poetry readings by contributors
    to stillpoint (the literary magazine featuring student writers and endowed by
    emeritus university professor and senior associate dean dr. hugh ruppersburg and
    tricia ruppersburg).

    - to risk hyperbole, completing a degree is always a n achievement but to do so
    during a historical event such as the global pandemic is little short of heroic.

    - we hosted our first departmental graduation since 2019, and were lucky enough
    to have dr. meg amstutz, dean of the jere w. morehead honors college, deliver
    the commencement speech to our graduating seniors.

    - it was at unl that i moved through the ranks and was eventually promoted to
    full professor.

    - this event will be a continuation of "medieval on my mind,” and feature a series
    of panels by georgia medievalists on medieval objects and medievalism in the south.

    - we held a festive opening ceremony on august 28, 2024, where president morehead
    and dean anna stenport were among our invited speakers.

    - this event displayed the incredible range of talents in our cwp program and

    - the uga chapter of sigma tau delta , the national english honors society, welcomed
    twelve new members at its annual induction ceremony on thursday, november 9th
    at 5 p.m. in the park hall library.

    - “this semester was all about building up that foundation.” core philosophies
    were kept, such as the need to build a community within park hall, but now that
    the uea was established there was room to experiment with events and activities.

    - nina’s efforts to coordinate events, connect with club members, and her general
    effervescent personality will be sorely missed.

    - next semester, dani plans to continue nina’s legacy by doing more fun events,
    expanding the outreach of the club, and endeavoring to make the uea’s meetings
    something that all english majors look forward to attending.

    - the ongoing uga symposium on the book (co-curated by profs.

    - our second meeting, "unbinding book history," unspooled over two days of events
    in early september 2023 that explored the intricate connections among literature,
    book arts, and history.

    - the symposium also included two faculty panels, one with drs.

    - the symposium concluded with a masterclass with cynthia camp on a unique book
    of hours held by uga''s special collections libraries that examined one part of
    the book, the calendar, for idiosyncratic local saints.

    - collectively, these events blended creative practice with scholarly expertise,
    contemporary and theoretical approaches with historical perspectives, and cross-disciplinary
    conversations with hands-on learning.

    - in his role as graduate editor at the georgia review , anderson co-organized
    (with sarah shermyen) a graduate student symposium for spotlight on the arts,
    which took place at the athenaeum on november 12. in august, emily beckwith ''s

    lai''s landscapes and xyta maya murray''s god went like that ) and the mcneese

    in the work of willa cather" for publication in print in early 2024. she presented
    “our ambassadors to the future: the stories time capsules tell,” at the spotlight
    ecologies graduate student symposium alongside graduate students from english
    and lamar dodd.

    - i also now work in illustration, which feels both like a happy return and an
    extension of my academic background: i love working in monoline aesthetics, derivative
    of early modern woodcuts, and densely stylized maps, characteristic of seventeenth-century
    cartography.

    - this event was sponsored by the arts and humanities research council.

    - he recalls how the event “pulled people from the [english] department together”
    and “introduced them to a lot of people [he] cared about in melus.” his “real
    love in literature,” though, remains african american literature, and his fondest
    moments of his career involve teaching courses on the harlem renaissance, black
    writers in the south, and black women writers.

    - december 14th, 2023 the english department held their first winter graduation
    ceremony.

    - congradulations to all our december graduates, both those who were able to make
    the ceremony and those who had already left the halls of park!

    - our decision to organize just a few events between tcu and uga morphed into
    the year-long, eighteen-event program, “the genius of phillis wheatley peters:
    a poet and her legacies,” co-organized by dr. robbins and dr. mona narain, both
    of tcu, and me.

    - spring and fall 2023 events have been virtual, in-person, or hybrid.

    - so many english department faculty gave generously of their time and expertise
    as panelists or event organizers: david diamond, aruni kashyap, susan rosenbaum
    (interdisciplinary modernisms workshop), miriam jacobson and sujata iyengar (symposium
    on the book).

    - there, we experience a multitude of wonders: the pleasant cold that preserves
    the collections, an in-depth discussion of fire-precautions taken in the library,
    a look at football tickets from the 1929 commencement of sanford stadium, and
    a masterful demonstration of the forklift by paul.

    - this is just one of the events that has been planned and executed by the newly
    resuscitated english undergraduate association.

    - “my goal for the uea is to give the english major that smaller school feel of
    community, as well as give people the opportunity to meet different professors,
    go to events, work creatively, and have outlets for their work.” most of all,
    she hopes that the uea will continue after she graduates.

    - nineteen new members joined sigma tau delta in december and an induction ceremony
    was held in the park hall library.

    - they also hosted two events: a coffee and study hangout for members at zombie
    donuts and a general body assembly.

    association conference, atlanta in april, 2023; and “displacement, destruction,
    and despair: sollors and garcia revision refugees, ruins, and forgetting in post-war
    germany” at the modern language association, san francisco, in january, 2023.
    barbara mccaskill led with sarah robbins (tcu) both virtual and in-person events
    titled “the genius of phillis wheatley peters: a poet and her legacies.” the project
    was recently discussed in a may 4 boston globe essay by tiana howard.

    - eventually, clare wishes to pursue a ph.d through uga’s paid tuition for faculty
    program, likely following a similar subject as her masters: medieval art, specifically
    art made by nuns and religious women in the 12th and 13th centuries.

- intent: ask_academic_program
  examples: '- in english or its equivalent, and a solid undergraduate grade-point
    average (at least a 3.0), especially in english courses (3.65 or better), as well
    as positive letters of recommendation and other evidence of scholastic achievement,
    including proficiency in writing.

    - course work.

    - program at the university of georgia encourages students to take courses in
    a variety of areas to broaden and deepen their literary and critical backgrounds.

    - the program offers a two-year degree, which requires 30 hours of course work
    (one course is three hours of credit), at least three hours of which must represent
    research on their thesis.

    - students will complete a core requirement of one course from each of three literary
    divisions: students will also specialize in an area of concentration (defined
    as three related courses) from one of our thematic arcs.

    - students will round out their program of study with a course from another thematic
    arc plus two electives.

    - at the end of their course work, students must pass an oral examination covering
    their course of study, a portfolio of three essays written in their courses, and
    a selective list of major works studied.

    - it may take the form of an academic thesis (necessary for those considering
    a ph.d. program here or elsewhere); a pedagogical study, such as a curriculum
    or a teaching approach to a text; or a project employing methods from one of the
    concentrations, such as a computer program or an edition.

    - to qualify for admission, an applicant must hold at least a b.a., and preferably
    an m.a., in english; have a high grade-point average (at least 3.0 in undergraduate
    studies), especially in english courses (3.65 or better in undergraduate english
    classes).

    - while most of the applicants who are admitted in the ph.d. program already hold
    a master''s degree in english, applicants with exceptional undergraduate records
    may be admitted directly into the doctoral program without an m.a.

    - course work.

    - will take a minimum of 27 hours of course work (one course is three hours of
    credit) before admission to candidacy, three hours of which must be dissertation
    research (9300).

    - students entering the program with a bachelor''s degree will take a minimum
    of 45 hours of course work, exclusive of research hours, before admission to candidacy.

    - for each entering student, the graduate coordinator serves as the first advisor
    and then appoints a temporary major advisor, who provides counsel on course work
    and general directions for study.

    - course requirements.

    - spends the first two years of study completing course work, the third year studying
    for the written and oral examinations, and the fourth year completing the dissertation.

    - devotes the first three years to course work, the fourth year to studying for
    the examination, and the final year to completing the dissertation.

    - new graduate students should plan to satisfy this portion of their degree requirements
    as soon after matriculation as possible.

    - the ph.d. is not a creative writing degree.

    - academic standards and program requirements for are the same for creative writing
    students as those for non-creative writing students (see above) with the following
    exception: creative writing students are expected to take at least one creative
    writing class per year (engl 6800 or 8800) as part of their required course work.

    - sample courses include the first book of poetry, the art of translation, the
    art of the book, novel form, novel genres, and publishing and editing.

    - finally, the department offers many opportunities for advanced graduate students
    to teach undergraduate courses in american literature.

    - consider the dual degree.

    - the department of english and the college of education have worked together
    to combine the degree requirements of the a.b and the b.s.ed.

    - the result is a dual degree in english/english education that provides the satisfaction
    of a broad-based liberal arts education plus pre-professional training and certification.

    - please note: you must have the same tentative graduation date listed on both
    your english and english education majors in order to meet the requirements for
    dual degree status.

    - curriculum .

    - over the course of the five-year program our students develop research specialties
    that complement their writing practice and prepare them professionally for a teaching
    career at the university or college level.

    courses in various literary specialties.

    - a list of our department’s recent graduate course offerings can be found here
    .

    - the past decade has seen an over-enrollment in certain subjects (law, business);
    this over-enrollment has led to a market glut and the subsequent challenge of
    employability for those who had degrees they’d presumed to be tickets to solvency.

    - amidst the flight from humanities, the number of english majors here at uga
    remains what it was a decade ago, though it’s dropped dramatically elsewhere.

    - i have no doubt that all the departments and programs at a university have the
    potential to arouse that appetite, but i also know that it’s often beside the
    point when students choose a major based on some dim expectation of employability.

    - in fact, i had recently tallied the gender profile of students in our spring
    term courses.

    - the picture that emerges is even more extreme when we look at upper division
    courses, since only majors can take those.

    - basically then, it’s clear that female english majors are the great majority:
    only one or two of ten is male.

    - i routinely teach the undergraduate course, “literary theory,” in which we study
    contemporary approaches to the interpretation of texts.

    - as the course isn’t focused on one genre of literature or one particular historical
    period, i encounter students from multiple backgrounds, and i relish the opportunity
    to engage the complex minds in my class as we explore complex ideas together.

    - according to several historical records, as recounted by former franklin college
    senior associate dean, hugh ruppersburg, our department, as such, came into existence
    around 1915, with women joining the uga student body in 1918. although the university
    was founded in 1785, the focus of the curriculum at the university of georgia
    was on the study of greek, latin, logic, and moral, natural and political philosophy.

    - one of the courses i regularly teach, literary theory, introduces students,
    as the course title suggests, to a variety of contemporary theories that help
    us interpret literature.

    - speaking of the writing center, the fall semester of 2024 marked a major milestone
    in the history of this facility.

    department of english where dr. alexander taught most of his courses.

    - you can earn course credit for research in any department regardless of year,
    gpa, or major.

    and new connections between english majors.

    senior members remembered what it had been like to be a freshman english major,
    still isolated from the department and having few, if any, friends within it.

    - in truth i became an english major more so out of necessity than by choice.

    - at the university of tennessee, my major was studio art until my junior year,
    when some nerve-related issues led me to lose partial control of my dominant hand,
    and i could no longer draw to fulfill my coursework.

    - what feels most significant among all the lessons i learned from my english
    major is the skill of writing.

    - and i think (and hope) english majors are better able to leverage that skill
    to see through some pretty cool opportunities.

    - i am not and have never been a gamer, but there was and is a major appeal to
    me in the world-building side of playing games that, also as a creative, i am

    - abigail bales is a sophomore majoring in english and double minoring in studio

    - near the end of fall 2022, dr. reeves had asked the english majors within her
    utopian literature class if they would want to be involved in reviving the english
    undergraduate association, whose corpse had cooled in the ground after the last
    few rounds of graduates.

    - we knew of our fellow english majors, yet there was no single space for us to
    gather, united with purpose, beyond the classroom.

    - there wasn’t really a space to gather,” says mann sy tha, a junior comparative
    literature and english major.

    - many english majors felt disconnected from one another, simply because there
    was no space for them within park hall to connect with other english majors.

    - that changed because of the efforts of the eua, especially their president,
    nina meier, a rising senior majoring in english.

    - nina became the president of the eua “to create a greater community within park
    hall, specifically for english majors.” despite planning to graduate in the fall,
    nina felt like she didn’t know many english majors.

    - in the first year writing department, dr. king is known for his game-based writing
    courses that rely on video games and game design to “defamiliarize” students’
    understandings of rhetorical choices and the “experiences” that texts offer.

    - his initial interest in pairing writing/rhetoric with gaming began in a graduate
    course taught dr. iyengar in 2012. in that course, he designed a video game based
    on edmund spenser’s the faerie queen (1590), a project that radically changed
    how he experienced spenser’s text.

    - since that initial encounter with writing and gaming, he has taught multiple
    iterations of his game-based writing course, both at the 3000- and 1000-level,
    at various institutions, including at the university of georgia and georgia tech.

    - when “pitching” the course to students, dr. king emphasizes the experiential
    nature of reading/writing a text and playing games.

    - when students play what remains of edith finch, a “more narrative” and “story-based
    game,” they discuss how the game “create[s] meaning” and “work[s]…as storytelling.”
    throughout the course, dr. king emphasizes to students that “when they’re writing
    something, they’re still creating an experience” as they “think about an audience,”
    “structure something,” and “make rhetorical devices in…writing.” as students design
    their own games for the final project, they create these “experiences” through
    a platform that makes rhetorical choices “really noticeable,” a process that is
    often too “subtle” for students when their exposure to rhetoric is limited to
    traditional texts.

    - dr. king “sets apart” his most recent version of the course, a 3000-level class
    taught in fall 2022, as the most “impressive” one because of a small change to
    the final project.

    - they had real questions, they had work lists, they divided things and used monday…to
    assign themselves work for the rest of the week.” seeing students actively guide
    themselves through their projects was one of the most rewarding aspects of the
    course for dr. king.

    - the course she’s teaching this semester, a single-author study on jane austen,
    had gone to see samples of regency era fabric—exactly what characters in jane
    austen’s novels would have worn.

    in the formation of new identities for individuals recovering from trauma, and
    then applying those concepts to a comparative analysis of two book-length literary
    works (in different genres for added degree of difficulty).

    she identifies as “geohumoralism.” her work on the history of emotion helped initiate
    the “affective turn” in early modern literary scholarship.

    - the book argues that fiction and discourse about poverty in britain in the later

    - while all programs of study will necessarily include familiarity with at least
    one period of english literature, the flexibility of graduate requirements in
    english will allow students to follow their own interests in the selection of
    their coursework.

    - els can help students negotiate style, both as readers and writers: stylistics
    embodies the essential connection between literature and els in grammar, discourse,

    language acquisition, style, and language variation and the linguistics of speech,
    treat specific topics and theories related to the english language.

    - programs of study will include familiarity with at least one period of english
    literature; the flexibility of requirements in english will allow students to
    follow their own interests in the selection of their coursework.

    - in this accelerated course of study, students will undertake advanced, individualized
    research projects before the end of their ab, projects that will feed into their
    ma thesis.

    - the dual degree also prepares you to enter into a doctoral program, whether
    in english or in a related field.

    - students interested in entering the pathway to the dual degree program should
    plan to attend the information sessions held by the english department graduate

    requirement.

    - advanced graduate students have the opportunity to teach courses in british
    literature and are eligible to teach “introduction to british culture,” the gateway
    course in the uga british-irish studies program.

    - the fyw course evaluation schedule can be found in your elw course.

    - all fyw courses share a set of core goals, or learning outcomes, which are detailed
    below and are also reflected in the program grading rubric and capstone electronic
    portfolio assignment.

    - english 1101 focuses on informational, analytical, and argumentative writing
    (the principal genres of academic discourse that students will encounter in many
    courses across the curriculum), and on research skills and critical thinking.

    - our learning outcomes are arranged under four threshold concepts that are most
    important for students in uga’s english 1101 courses.

    - each concept includes a bulleted list of the learning objectives, suggesting
    how students will engage with these ideas in their 1101 courses.

    - first-year writing guide (digital version) the norton field guide to writing,
    6 th edition primary texts must be chosen by course instructor.

    - to graduate, however, students must have earned a grade of “c” in english 1101
    and have a combined average grade of “c” in english 1101 and 1102. students therefore
    are strongly advised not to enroll in english 1102 until they have received a
    "c" in english 1101. according to the university policy on plus-minus grading,
    a grade of “c-” will not satisfy the requirement for a “c” in engl 1101; a combined
    average of “c-“ or 1.7 in english 1101 and 1102 will not satisfy the requirement
    for a combined average of “c” in the two courses.

    - english 1102 shares the core goals, or learning outcomes, of english 1101, but
    includes as well other goals specific to the course.

    - primary required: first-year writing guide (digital version found on departmental
    website) text(s) must be chosen by course instructor.

    - these courses have the same general goals as other first-year writing courses
    at the university of georgia, but each class is designed individually by the instructor,
    often around a special topic.

    - in the regular, eight-week "thru term" of summer school, the first-year writing
    program offers english 1102e, a fully online, asynchronous course.

    - these courses often focus on topics related to the instructor’s research or
    scholarly interests, and the sections are marked by a special note in athena.

    - english 1101s allows students to hone their developing writing skills through
    community service while still fulfilling the goals of a standard 1101. depending
    on the focus of the course, 1101s may involve field trips and out-of-class community
    service as well as community based writing projects.

    - all students in a first-year writing course at uga produce a polished portfolio
    of their semester''s work in the class.

    - part of each student’s course grade will also be determined by a portfolio of
    written work.

    - two revised essays from the course.

    - students can find these resources in their elc course under "content" --> "fyw
    resources and info"

    - 2024-2025 first year writing guidebook full guidebook: 2024-2025 first-year
    writing guidebook individual chapters: introduction, table of contents, chapter
    1 chapter 2: description of courses chapter 3: policies and procedures chapter
    4: elw handbook chapter 5: evaluation of essays chapter 6: eportfolios chapter
    7: academic honesty & plagiarism chapter 8: resources chapter 9: what comes next?

    - english 1101 is concerned with argumentative discourse, english 1102 with constructing
    academic arguments through literature.

    - we also offer a wide range of special topics courses, online writing classes,
    and composition courses.

    - the capstone project for both courses is an electronic portfolio of student
    work.

    - however, some students will receive credit for these courses based on the following
    tests.

    - 4. incoming dual enrollment students who already have credit for first-year
    writing courses will not need to take the placement exam.

    - 5. students with an sat score of 580 or below who have no other form of placement
    from a national test are required to take the english departmental placement exam
    before registering for any fyw courses.

    - it should be emphasized that when students miss class, regardless of whether
    the absence is excused or not, it is the responsibility of the student to keep
    up with the course.

    - for each unexcused absence in excess of six (for mwf classes) or in excess of
    four (for mw and tth classes), three points will be deducted from the student’s
    final grade in the course.

    - 1) students considering an appeal regarding a final grade in an fyw course should
    first read uga''s guidance on the academic appeals process, available on the uga
    honesty site''s grade appeals page .

    - 2) after final grades have been recorded, the student should first appeal to
    the course instructor.

    - in the appeal to the fyw program director the student should include: a) a cover
    letter explaining the grounds for the appeal; b) all relevant supporting documentation;
    c) copies of all appeal materials that were submitted to the course instructor
    in step 2. the fyw program director will not consider appeals received more than
    30 days after final grades were recorded.

    - it indicates that students have completed almost all of the course work satisfactorily
    but were unable to meet the full requirements of the course for reasons beyond
    their control.

    - when assigning incompletes, instructors will explain i n writing what students
    must do to finish the course.

    - an “i” is never assigned prior to mid-semester or for the purpose of allowing
    students to repeat courses.

    - plus and minus grades are assigned only to a student’s final average for the
    course.

    - for the final course grade, the numerical range for each plus/minus grade is
    as follows:

    - note: 4000-level courses require two 2000-level engl courses or (one 2000-level
    engl course and one 3000-level engl course) or (one 2000-level engl course and
    one 2000-level cmlt course) as prerequisites.

    - at least three of the english classes must be english department literature
    courses.

    - - four courses must be taken at the university of georgia; two courses may be
    transferred from elsewhere.

    - - a grade of "c" (2.0) or better must be earned in all minor courses.

    - we are a large department of approximately 300 majors and 100 minors.

    - in any given semester, you will find courses that explore the sweep of american
    and british literature, as well as courses in creative writing, literary theory,
    and in particular genres like science fiction.

    - the english major allows for great flexibility, and students can choose to focus
    their studies according to their own interests.

    - the majority of our courses are taught in a discussion format with great attention
    paid to the nuances of language and style.

    - if you wish to concentrate your studies within the english major in a particular
    area of emphasis, click here for more information.

    - early modern british and american literature 4300/6300: elizabethan poetry 4310:
    tudor literature 4320/6320: shakespeare i: selected works 4330: shakespeare ii:
    special topics* *special topics is repeatable for 6 credit hours, but may only
    be counted once towards the english and american literature before 1800 requirement.

    - an area of emphasis is a group of four or more related courses within a major
    or coherent field of study.

    - the english department introduced areas of emphasis to the major in the spring
    of 2009. our current areas of emphasis are: advanced studies in english , american
    literature , creative writing , eighteenth-century literature , english language
    studies , interdisciplinary renaissance studies , humanities computing , medieval
    literature , multicultural american literature , poetics , rhetoric and composition
    , and studies in the novel .

    - by declaring an area of emphasis within your english major, you can now map
    out the best way to satisfy all your major requirements while still focusing ly
    on the fields you find most interesting.

    - each area has a set of required courses as well as a selection of "emphasis
    elective" courses from which students may choose.

    - the age witnessed the creation of the novel as a literary genre, the honing
    of ethics as a philosophical practice, the emergence of feminist discourse, and
    the rise of commercial culture and capitalism.

    - the courses in this area will introduce you to the modern age (the age in which
    we still live) at its inception.

    - students are encouraged to take a 5th course from the following list: elan 4450:
    teaching writing in the secondary school or jour 3410: new writing and reporting
    or jour 3410h: news writing and reporting this area of emphasis examines what
    makes "the novel" unique within english studies, studying examples of the novel
    from the inception of the genre through contemporary explorations of what the
    medium can do.

    - please note the following: courses outside the english major may have lower
    division prerequisites.

    - check the university bulletin to find out what prerequisites you may need in
    order to enroll in courses outside of the english major.

    - also note: while many graduate level courses are accepted for various areas
    of emphasis, only 3 graduate level courses in total may be applied toward an undergraduate
    degree at the university of georgia.

    essay in their chosen area of research demonstrating technical writing and organization
    skills.

    - students entering the ph.d. program with a previous graduate degree sufficient
    to cover this basic knowledge will need to work with their advisory committee
    to certify their core competency.

    - a grade average of at least 3.56 (e.g., a-, a-, b+) must be achieved for the
    three core courses.

    - students below this average may take an additional core course and achieve a
    grade average of at least 3.32 (e.g., a-, b+, b+, b).

    - primary focus the primary focus consists of at least 31 credit hours of resident
    graduate coursework.

    - this includes at least 8 credit hours of advanced csci graduate coursework at
    the 6000/8000-level (see “advanced coursework” below).

    - this must include 4 credit hours of coursework open only to graduate students
    exclusive of 6950 and 8990, as per graduate school policy.

    - no course used to fulfill part of the requirements for item #1, #2, or #4 may
    be used to fulfill part of another requirement (for example, item #1 hours are
    separate and different from item #2 hours, item #4 hours are separate and different
    from item #1 hours and item #2 hours).

    - see the csci section of the university of georgia bulletin for course descriptions.

    - note: no course with a grade of c+ or lower may be included on the student’s
    program of study (see the graduate bulletin for other gpa constraints).

    coursework requirement count toward the advanced coursework requirement and the
    core curriculum requirement.

    - at most one of the 8000-level courses may be repeated once.

    - that course must be listed in the catalog as repeatable and syllabi from both
    offerings of the course must be submitted to the graduate coordinator with the
    program of study, showing that the two offerings differ in content.

    - while working on his/her dissertation, the student must enroll for a minimum
    of 6 credit hours of csci 9300 doctoral dissertation spread over at least 2 semesters.

    - advice for new transfer students a degree from uga means more!

    - a degree in computer science from uga can provide you with a stronger skillset
    and excellent employment opportunities.

    - your school may not have prepared you for the rigor of the courses you’ll find
    here, but there are ways to help make that up.

    - any courses that do not transfer as direct uga equivalents according to our
    transfer equivalency database can be re-evaluated.

    - even if the courses do not end up as direct uga csci equivalents, you will still
    receive elective credit for the courses.

    - they will also consider the content and rigor of any cs courses you completed
    at other institutions.

    - computer science as a discipline builds on foundational knowledge gained in
    the introductory courses and rushing into courses without adequate preparation
    can lead to a much larger setback than starting in the right class.

    - in addition to creating a plan with your advisor, w e recommend reading our
    undergraduate course selection guide .

    - this will help you understand the prerequisite knowledge required for our introductory
    courses.

    - just make sure you follow the collaboration policies for your course(s) and
    the uga honesty policies .

    - students who have taken csci 1302 (or a similar course) can work through the
    other problems on the site.

    - leetcode : designed to help cs majors with the technical interview process,
    this site is useful to students throughout the curriculum.

    - we recommend starting your journey on leetcode once you get to the data structures
    (csci 2720) course at uga.

    - please look for opportunities for assistantships or part-time jobs in other
    departments as periodically posted on the cs majors listserv.

    - the hahn family scholarship fund this fund aims to offer need-based scholarships
    to recognize exceptional undergraduate students majoring in computer science.

    - undergraduate course selection guide regardless of where you are in the csci
    curriculum, it is critical that you review the concepts taught in your previous
    (prerequisite) courses before starting classes each semester.

    - as an incoming uga student, you should also make sure the course you are considering
    is appropriate for your experience level.

    - this guide will help you select the appropriate csci course to begin with at
    uga.

    - the school of computing provides a course information sheet (cis) that outlines
    the learning outcomes and major topics covered for each course in the curriculum.

    - before taking any courses at uga, we recommend carefully reviewing the course
    information sheet (cis) for all prerequisite courses to ensure you are adequately
    prepared.

    - for example, if you plan on taking software development (csci 1302), you should
    first review the learning outcomes, major topics covered, and their associated
    knowledge levels in the csci 1301 cis .

    - if your introductory course was taught in python, you would need to take csci
    1301 at uga to build up your foundational java knowledge before moving to csci
    1302. if the learning outcomes for a prerequisite course are unfamiliar and/or
    the major topics weren’t covered at the required knowledge level at your previous
    institution, you are not ready to move into the next course.

    - instead, you should start by taking a course at the appropriate level to build
    your foundational knowledge before moving ahead.

    - in some situations, the setback can extend the time required to earn your degree
    by up to a year.

    - course-specific information: you can find the course information sheet for each
    course in our csci course list or by following a specific course link below.

    - simply click the course you plan to take and then scroll down to the “course
    information file” pdf on the school of computing website.

    - here, we outline course-specific details along with the required prerequisite
    knowledge for each course.

    - we highly recommend clicking on the link for each course, reading the high-level
    list of concepts covered and then reviewing the full course information sheet
    (cis).

    - click a link below to jump directly to a course you are considering: csci 1300
    : introduction to programming with python if you are a non-major or are considering
    a computer science degree, minor, or certificate but are unsure if it is right
    for you, this is a great place to begin.

    - the course has no prerequisites and is a gentler introduction to programming
    than csci 1301. csci 1300 does not fill any major requirements.

    - csci 1301 : introduction to computing and programming prerequisite: math 1113

    and students are expected to be able to implement software solutions that incorporate
    all of the topics from csci 1301 along with new topics in csci 1302 in a unix
    terminal environment.

    - there is little time spent on reviewing concepts from csci 1301. however, your
    instructors will send out instructions outlining how you can review and practice
    your programming skills a few weeks before the course begins.

    - csci 1730 : systems programming prerequisite: csci 1302 if you completed csci
    1301 and csci 1302 at another institution and you received credit for both courses,
    we recommend that you review the csci 1302 course information sheet and speak
    with your academic advisor before taking this course.

    - this course focuses on the c programming language which is considered a lower-level
    (r to the hardware) language than java.

    - bachelor of science the school offers a bachelor of science (bs-cs) in computer
    science degree, accredited by the computing accreditation commission of abet .

    - computer science area of emphasis in addition to fulfulling the major requirements
    (15 hours), major electives (12 hours), and major-related electives (15 hours)
    of the bs-cs degree, students may elect to specialize in one of the eight areas
    of emphasis listed below .

    - an area of emphasis is an acknowledgment of the attainment of a fair measure
    of expertise and knowledge of a specific nature within the major field of study.

    - courses may satisfy both requirements for the major and requirements for an
    area of emphasis.

    - eligibility for the computing certificate program: this program is open to undergraduate
    and post–baccalaureate students in any major except computer science.

    - students who will receive a minor in csci are not eligible for the certificate
    of computing .

    - there are no prerequisite courses to enter the program, but students must complete
    math 1113 or equivalent before taking csci 1301–1301l, one of the required courses
    for the certificate.

    - what''s the difference between the certificate and a minor?

    - the computer science minor requires at least 9 hours of upper-division courses
    in cs, while the certificate in computing does not.

    - in essence, the certificate in computing represents a strong concentration in
    a subject area, short of a major.

    - course requirements for the certificate in computing: required courses (complete
    all the courses below) semester hours csci 1100 - 1100l* topics in computing 3
    csci 1301 introduction to computing and programming 4 csci 1302 software development

    18 - 20 * a more advanced course from the list of electives above can be substituted
    for csci 1100-1100l.

    - **** all elective courses must be taken in residence.

    - the minor in computer science what''s the difference between the certificate
    and a minor?

    - the computer science minor requires at least 17 hours of computer science courses.

    - students must complete csci-1302, csci-2610 and at least 9 hours of upper-division
    (3000-4999) courses in csci.

    - however, many (but not all) upper division cs courses have a pre-requisite of
    csci 2720, which represents approximately 20 hours of lower-division prerequisites.

    - the school of computing does offer several upper-division courses that have
    a pre-requisite lower than csci 2720: csci 3030, csci 4130, csci 4140, csci 4150,
    csci 4300, csci 4540, csci 4550, csci 4560, csci 4810, and csci 4800. please check
    with the uga bulletin for the current pre-requisite listings.

    - alternatively, the certificate in computing provides a strong concentration
    in a subject area, short of a major.

    - students who enroll in the certificate program may, if they wish, continue to
    a minor or major in cs.

    - applying for the minor in computer science log into athena , then under the
    student tab, click my programs and then add minor.

    - miscellaneous policies as a reminder, uga''s bulletin states that courses taken
    to satisfy core areas i through v may not be counted as course work in the minor.

    - courses taken in core area vi may be counted as course work in the minor.

    - the purpose of the minor is to complete coursework in a field of study other
    than the student''s major.'
- intent: ask_contact_info
  examples: '- there are no required courses, but the student''s advisory committee
    may recommend or require specific courses that provide a foundation for the dissertation,
    address particular gaps in a student''s preparation, or round out a special area
    of concentration.

    used for various biomedical applications in the field.

    - semantic applications in the areas of biology, health care, national security,
    financial services, and risk & compliance have been built.

    - these types of systems are used in many applications incuding airplane autopilot
    systems and powerplant controllers.

    - because these systems are often used in safety critical applications, it is
    essential that we can guarantee the timing requirements will be met before the
    system is used.

    - since parallel processing systems are being used in the most compute-intensive
    applications, we have been investigating the implications of parallel processing
    in the areas of interest to us: image processing, robot vision, satellite data
    processing, matrix reduction, nonlinear wave equations, banded, circulant, and
    toeplitz systems of equations, multivariable partial differential equations, and
    vlsi physical design.

    - since parallel systems are often awkward to quite difficult to implement applications
    on, we have an interest in improved programming, networking, and development environments
    for parallel systems.

    - we have proposed a new parallel systems architecture (the reconfigurable multiring)
    that is more efficient, easier to program, and lower cost for certain applications.

    - the research in low- and high-level vision is being applied to several application
    areas such as automated industrial inspection, geographic information systems
    and multi-media systems.

    - the network research group focuses on the problem of building efficient, scalable
    and secure networks and applications.

    - the research topics include building fast packet forwarding and inspections,
    designing methods to reduce deployment efforts for network protocols and applications,
    building scalable network services, and improving the accuracy and performance
    of network security systems.

    - algorithms and combinatorics the design and analysis of advanced algorithms
    is useful in a variety of applications.

    - he is interested in the design and development of parallel algorithms, numerical
    methods and software systems that can harness the full potential of state-of-the-art
    computing platforms to address challenging problems in large scale data-intensive
    scientific applications.

    - such integration of heterogeneous and open data sources will require automated
    methods for reconciling syntactic and semantic differences among semi-structured
    sources as well as filtering out noises and misinformation in order to achieve
    the quality of service and quality of information requirements of a mission-critical
    application such as disaster management.
